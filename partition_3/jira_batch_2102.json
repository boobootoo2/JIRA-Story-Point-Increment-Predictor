Problem statement\nCurrently, page restrictions only allow you to define a set of users and groups that _can_ view or edit a page.\n\nh5. Suggested solution\nSometimes an administrator or page owner wants to set the page restrictions of a page in Confluence to be viewable/editable by all users in Confluence except for a select few.\n\nIn that scenario, it is practically far, much easier if there is a \"blocked\" permission as well, where the administrator or page owner can straight away define the set of users who *don't have permission* to view/edit the page.\n\nh5. Example\nI want to set the page restrictions for Page A whereby only 95 out of 100 users in Confluence can view the page.\n\nAll 95 users are scattered across different groups and do not belong in a single common group. It is impractical to individually list out all 95 users, compared to listing the 5 users who can't view the page.",

Summary\nJira Issues Macro is not displaying custom date fields in the user time zone (Confluence), but rather the server time zone (Confluence)\n\nh5. Environment\nConfluence with applink to Jira\n\nh5. Steps to Reproduce\n# In Jira, create a ticket with a custom date field and a custom date time field.\n# Set the Jira user time zone to be different to the server time zone so that the custom fields display a different date.\n# In Confluence, create a page with this issue and set the display option to table format with the custom fields.\n# Set the Confluence user time zone to be the same as the Jira user time zone (assuming Confluence Server time zone is same as Jira).\n\nh5. Expected Results\nCustom date and date time fields in Jira and Confluence display the same date and time.\n\nh5. Actual Results\nCustom date and date time fields in Jira is displayed correctly according to user time zone settings while Confluence displays custom date and date time fields in Confluence Server time zone.\nCustom date time fields can also be truncated to just the date and show the wrong date (in server time zone)\n\nh5. Notes\nThis behaviour is seen on both cloud and confluence server.\nJira rest endpoint is returning the custom date and custom date time fields in Jira user time zone eg {{<customfieldvalue>Wed, 20 Jul 2016 18:48:00 +0200</customfieldvalue>}}, JIM macro is incorrectly transforming this to Confluence server time zone instead of Confluence user time zone.\n\nh5.

Summary\nLoading of a page that contains Page Properties Report Macro is considerably slower in the later version of Confluence when having a large number of items to display.\nThis is being compared to an earlier version of Confluence, such as the version 5.5.4 where a page that contains Page Properties Report Macro large number of items to display loaded in a matter of seconds.\n\nh3. Environment\n* Confluence 5.9.4\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\nh5. Use the sample Space Export\n# Get this XML space export [^Confluence-space-export-225313-4.xml.zip]\n# Load the page with the title \"PP Report Macro with Number of items to display = 1000\" from the xml export\n\nh5. Or, have a huge number of pages that have a \"Page Properties\" Macro\n# Create a page and insert the *Page Properties* Macro in it\n# Add simple table \n !screenshot-1.png|thumbnail! \n# Save the page, and add a distinct label to this page, for example \"decisions\"\n# Add 1000 additional pages in this space with the same content and label\n# Add another page, insert the \"Page Properties Report\" Macro > Edit this macro > and add the label from step 3. Example, \"decisions\".\n\nh3. Expected Results\nShould load in a matter of seconds\n\nh3. Actual Results\nPage properties report macro shows \"{{Generating page properties report}}\" while loading its content. After a seemingly long time, the page loaded. After a case review the page fully loads after ~6 minutes. Here is the the comparison between Confluence 5.9.4 and 5.5.4:\n\n!image-2016-06-07-22-52-09-641.png!\n\nh3. Notes\n# The loading time could differ from one instance to another. The table above represents the difference between the two versions.\n# This issue only happens if there are no rich contents in the page report macro, as they will be affected by the following bug instead:\n#* [Page Properties Report Macro only displays 30 results|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-40898]",

In the macro setting, I've set the width to 100% with the intention that the video scales in height to match the aspect of whatever the 100% width value ends up being in real terms: which is to say, to use the full amount of space available to it in the left-hand section/div.\n\nThis isn't happening.\n\nThe height of the video seems to have a max height of 380px (unless I specify otherwise in the macro, which isn't appropriate for what I'm trying to achieve here) leading to that wasted space at the edges - that's space that my video content could be using to show a larger picture. \n\nThe video element - which curiously is embedded in a virtual #document element, meaning I can't access it to change its styles in the global stylesheet - appears to use the object-fit CSS selector, which defaults to 'contain' based on the default user agent stylesheet. Furthermore, this may or may not have something to do with the line:\n\n<param name=\"scale\" value=\"aspect\"> element within the object used to display the video. Whatever, that parameter is not available to me to set or change.\n\nWhat I need is to have the object-fit selector be able to be set to 'fill' by the addition of some extra option, or just have this be the default behaviour of video content in Confluence, to ensure my video content is displayed using the maximum amount of space possible and actually uses a width of 100% of the containing div, not some fraction of 100% based on some arbitrary max height that I didn't set and can't alter.",

Current behavior \n\nCurrently, when you try to export a page to word, the created word doc will be named using the title of the page. If the page title contains spaces, it will be replaced by \"+\" in the filename.\nExample:\n*Page Title:* this is a test\n*Filename:* this+is+a+test.doc\n\n\nh5. Suggestion\n\nIt would be nice to add the possibility for users to pick the filename delimiter. An interface in the general configuration to pick the delimiter.\nExample:\nThe user can pick \"_\" as delimiter\n*Page Title:* this is a test\n*Filename:* this_is_a_test.doc",

There is no logging at other levels either.\n\nI suspect this began after implementing the Office Connector [canary process|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CONFKB/JVM+crashes+during+Import+from+Word+in+Confluence], however it could also have been due to the dependency changes required for plugins4.\n\nLogging for the canary process and some parts of the Office Connector \u00a0(eg below) go to the catalina.out, but is not formatted in the usual way (eg the timestamp). This is because it uses an SLF4J SimpleLogger, which is by design - it runs in an entirely separate JVM and is stripped down to pure essentials. It appears as though the dependencies\u00a0from this module are bleeding into the main JVM and breaking logging for the whole plugin.\n{code:java}\n147073 [scheduler_Worker-10] INFO com.atlassian.confluence.extra.officeconnector.index.excel.ExcelXMLTextExtractor - Not enough memory to extract all text from 'test.xlsx'.

I think it was to delete a space or to view the stats.\n\nA few days ago I stumbled upon a page in search. I had no idea this page was marked as restricted when I saw it. The authors noticed I viewed their secret page and reported me to upper management.\n\n*My superiors made the arrangements for my dismissal in the event that my explanation would not be satisfactory.* I could have been fired even though I was completely unaware I did anything wrong. The private information my colleagues place on confluence is freely and openly available to our wiki admins. I trust my DBAs to not go snooping in the DB, they don't normally SELECT on the tables. But admins imagining they're just another user and freely searching through everything makes it too hard to avoid a breach of privacy. Breaking access restrictions needs to be deliberate and logged. I'd recommend:\n\n* The definitions of each role need to be crystal clear. What they're allowed to do and not. Our wiki admin had no idea she granted me this much power.\n* Whenever an admin is using their privilege to breach user privacy - there should be giant modal flashing red lights preventing that from accidentally happening.\n* There should also be an admin action log dedicated to these privacy breaches. Or privilege escalations.\n\nAt the moment I'm going to recommend any organization with a high standard for secrecy or privacy to stay away from confluence. If you're already on confluence - make sure your admins have a separate admin account they never use unless they need to escalate their privileges.\n\nhttps://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-1444",

Use cases include:\n* Showing a high level summary of information to one audience without divorcing the summary from the details.\n* More easily reviewing an outline of information while focusing on the key points.\n* More easily navigating a page with an abundance of text.\n\nFor collapsing by headings, the Expando add-on exists, but it's not supported or available for Cloud.\nhttps://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.k15t.confluence.k15t-expando/server/overview\n\nFor lists, the built-in Expand Macro does not work with the built-in lists. It is essentially impossible to build a contiguous list while using Expand Macros for each item.\n\nSuggestions:\nLists would either be collapsible by default or could be wrapped in a new macro that enables this functionality. \nThe user should be able to expand a single item or all items at that level in the outline.\nPage editor should be able to designate whether a list is collapsed or expanded by default when viewed.\n\nFor an example of potential implementation of collapsible lists or outlines, see OneNote.\nhttps://support.office.com/en-us/article/Use-outlines-to-structure-notes-and-ideas-56373f1e-f55e-4356-8e87-32e650e5d832?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US#bm4\n\nAre there any applicable workarounds available today?",

Problem Definition\nIn Confluence Cloud, if default space permissions are not set to provide administrator permissions to a Confluence site administrator group or for some other reason admin access is lost, then site administrators must contact Atlassian Support to regain access as described [here|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/ConfCloud/Space+Permissions+Overview]:\nbq.If you accidentally deny all admin access to a space so that nobody has access to administer the space any more, you can ask someone with Confluence Administrator global permission to Assign Space Permissions. In Confluence Cloud this means you'll need to create a support request.  \n\nThis is especially frustrating for administrators who must regain access to personal and global spaces from individuals who have left the organization.\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\nThere are two possible solutions:\n# Grant the ability to use the Confluence Administrator permission (as also mentioned in [CONF-31974|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-31974]\n# Provide a new feature that will allow administrators to recover access to personal spaces. \n",

It would also remove a huge annoyance with using it. I promise, it at least sounds like a small change.\n\nPlease refer to the attached photos to help understand my suggestion:\n\n*'before' image:*\n* Shows the attachment macro widget. I've only one file listed.\n* Problem 1 - when you have 78 versions of a file, you have to scroll all the way to the bottom to find the 'edit in office' button.\n* Problem 2 - the average business user (not techie) won't find the 'edit in office' button and therefore simply download the file, rather than edit it.\n* These problems prevent me from using confluence as a document management system outside of the tech groups. Don't worry, we won't store 1,000s of docs, but we do want to store some.\n\n*'after' image*\n* Move the buttons to where I've shown them i.e. in line with the document name.\n* Make the buttons only display on hover i.e. you would only ever show one row of buttons at any time, to avoid visual noise.\n\nI think this will help solve the problems I've outlined.\n\n",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-41720].\n  {panel}\n\nHi Atlassian-Team,\n\nfirst of all, I realy like the new Dashboard with the sidebar and a lot of my customers do as well. Just to make it even a little better, I've got a few suggestions, that would help make the work of a Confluence user even more efficient:\n\nh3. Updates\nActually, in larger systems nobody cares about all update or even hat the time to care about it. Even the popular content is most of the time not interesting for most people. If you'd like to work efficiently you realy need to customize your activity stream by yourself to just get the information you're interestet in. You can do so with watching or favoring content (spaces) People want to decide what they want to be informed about (PULL) and not getting PUSH-notified. Hence, *updates from my favorites > all updates* !\n\nh3. Tasks\nYou already started to get important content for a user out of the profile onto the dasboard. That's great and I'd even get further by moving other personal work content like *Tasks* or *Drafts* to the *My Work* category at the dashboard / sidebar.\n\nh3. Customize the dashboard\nLast but not least, since more and more items will be needed on the dashboard. it would be realy helpful, if admins and users could customize the dashboard / side easily similar to the sidebar of space by hiding specific elements that they dont need.\n\nI hope that will help you to keep on improving Confluence even more!\nCheers\nFlorian",
