In this build, once all the tests pass and all the other checks are successful we tag the commit with a version number - this certifies to our team that this commit is good to proceed to the next stage in our deployment. This provides us with certainty that each and every change we make is stable, but as you might have guessed this means that we can only process one pull request at a time.\n\nIf we merge more than one PR into master then our tagging system risks getting confused - which creates work for our team to clean up.

But if several months ago only one of three IP-addresses of the domain was blocked (104.192.143.2), then approximately two weeks our providers blocked access to all IP-addresses of the domain (104.192.143.1, 104.192.143.2, 104.192.143.3).\\\\\nHere is the official response of the Ministry of Information of Kazakhstan: https://dialog.egov.kz/blogs/all-questions/493169 , https://dialog.egov.kz/blogs/all-questions/493062 , https://dialog.egov.kz/questioncontroller/view?id=491464 (use Google Translate).\\\\\nIn short - our Ministry found on the bitbucket.org signs of propaganda of narcotic drugs (yes, that&#x27;s funny). And they are trying to find contacts with the administration of the website (maybe even a legal address to send a letter by post, we can expect anything). Maybe someone of the support team can write them a message and ask what they want to delete? Their contacts are here: http://mic.gov.kz/en/kategorii/kontakty-18",
