Set the header to \"Epic\" and insert a JIRA link to the epic you created.\n# Duplicate this page 25-30 times\n# Create a new page, and insert the \"Page Properties Report\" macro\n## Enter \"report\" as the label\n## Enter \"epic\" as a field to be displayed\n## Save the report page and refresh\n\nh5.Expected Results\nThe page should be displayed as quickly since issues from JIRA should be batched (as per https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-31899)\n\nDisplaying lots of JIRA issues on a page isn't a problem - a dozen or so issues on a single macro, displayed 3-4 times on a single page loads almost instantly.\n\nh5.Actual Results\nThe page properties report macro can take a noticeably longer period of time to load. The performance problem can be exacerbated by higher usage in a production environment.\n\nh5.Workaround\nRemove any fields containing a JIRA macro from the page properties report macro.

(see [^back to export pdf options.png]) A user may then click on the Export button, either in an attempt to get the page list to be displayed, or on the assumption that the same page selection will be used as last time. This triggers an accidental full space export which consumes resources needlessly. \n\nWorkaround is to click on Custom Export or change the export type to Normal Export and then back to Custom, so that the page selection is displayed and the user can set the pages to export (again).\n\nNote that the behaviour is different with Firefox 31 ESR. In that case when you go \"back\" to the Export PDF Options page after doing a custom export of selected pages, *all* selections are reset to initial values. This means that the type is set back to Normal Export. It's not nice that the user's settings have been forgotten, but at least they are all forgotten consistently and it's unlikely that the user will be confused about what will happen when they click Export. \n\nWhat would really be nice is if the tool remembered *all* the export settings (export type and selected pages) so that a user could easily redo the same export. One of our users discovered this problem when they did a custom export, checked the results, discovered a problem, fixed it on the Confluence page, and then tried to go \"back\" to redo the same export.

Summary\n\nWhen sharing a non-SSL site via share-Blueprint, favicon and images are included as http elements too. That's reasonable but unfortunately totally wrong for Servers who are running SSL.\n\nThis will cause\n* Security exceptions in Browser\n* non-displayed content\n\ndepends on your browser.\n\nexample: https://wiki.childno.de/x/PQCDAQ\nso actually only testing with 5.44 ... will update soon, then I'll give an update if it still happens, but I'll bet it will ;/\n\nh3. Environment\nTesting in\n* Chrome\n* Mozilla\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n# Use a Confluence using HTTPS\n# Create a Page in Confluence selecting the 'Share Link' blueprint\n# Add a link to a page using HTTP\n\nh3. Expected Results\nThe page is secure over HTTPS\n\nh3. Actual Results\nSome contents, like icons, are displayed as HTTP. Encryption errors are shown, as the page is HTTPS, but some content uses HTTP.\n \nh3. Notes\nThis is related to so many other issues like\n[project = CONF AND (text ~ \"content\" OR text ~ \"insecure\" OR text ~ \"https\")|https://jira.atlassian.com/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20CONF%20AND%20(text%20~%20%22content%22%20OR%20text%20~%20%22insecure%22%20OR%20text%20~%20%22https%22)]\ne.g.\n* CONF-31901(Widget connector, not fixed)\n* CONF-31065 (What's new, fixed in 5.5)\n* CONF-31098 (youtube, fixed in 5.3.4)\n\nc'mon ... please check ALL you widgets, crawler, etc.\nseems to with 5.5. only a subset has been fixed (What's new).\nIt's really annoying for most business users!\n\nh3.Workaround\n*Partial workaround*\nEdit the page and remove the content that is not encrypted (it will be lost)",

When deactivating this plugin the \"standard search\" is shown which fully supports adding content types.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n- add a SiteSearchPluginModule like\n{code}\nimport com.atlassian.confluence.search.plugin.ContentTypeSearchDescriptor;\nimport com.atlassian.confluence.search.plugin.SiteSearchPluginModule;\nimport com.atlassian.confluence.search.v2.SearchQuery;\nimport com.atlassian.confluence.search.v2.query.LabelQuery;\n\n/**\n * Add some label as \"content type\" to filter the search.\n */\npublic class ByLabelSiteSearchPluginModule implements SiteSearchPluginModule\n{\n    \n    @Override\n    public Collection<ContentTypeSearchDescriptor> getContentTypeDescriptors() \n    {\n        Collection<ContentTypeSearchDescriptor> descriptors = new ArrayList<ContentTypeSearchDescriptor>();\n        // just for testing: add a single label\n        descriptors.add(new ByLabelSearchDescriptor(\"advanced\"));\n        return descriptors;\n    }\n\n    public static class ByLabelSearchDescriptor implements ContentTypeSearchDescriptor\n    {\n        private final String label;\n\n        public ByLabelSearchDescriptor(String label)\n        {\n            this.label = label;\n        }\n\n        @Override\n        public SearchQuery getQuery()\n        {\n            return new LabelQuery(label);\n        }\n\n        @Override\n        public String getIdentifier()\n        {\n            return \"byLabel_\" + label;\n        }\n\n        @Override\n        public String getI18NKey()\n        {\n            return org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils.capitalize(label) + \" pages\";\n        }\n\n        @Override\n        public boolean isIncludedInDefaultSearch()\n        {\n            return false;\n        }\n    }\n}\n{code} (This component adds a dummy \"content type\", which should restrict the search to all pages having the label \"advanced\")\n- register this class as a component in some atlassian-plugin.xml, e.g. {code}    <site-search name=\"By Label Site Search\" key=\"byLabelSiteSearch\" class=\"my.company.testcode.ByLabelSiteSearchPluginModule\">\n        <description>Test: Add label-types to Confluence site search</description>\n    </site-search>{code}\n- install this plugin in some confluence instance\n- log in to the confluence UI and trigger some search (e.g. with the standard demonstration space installed search for \"Advanced\")\n- on the search result page notice that there is an \"Advanced pages\" type in the left column\n- clicking on that link adds a parameter {{type=byLabel_advanced}} to the URL\n\nExpected behaviour\n- search results are restricted to pages with the label \"advanced\" (beside of containing the search term)\n \nObserved behaviour:\n- search result is the same as without choosing the \"Advanced pages\" content types \n\nThis problem only occurs if the Search plugin (Add-on key: {{com.atlassian.confluence.plugins.search.confluence-search}}) is installed and active.\nVersion of the plugin: 1.2.22\nIt only affects types defined by plugins; the preinstalled content types (\"pages\", \"blog posts\", \"attachments\" work fine). \n\nEither the plugin should not show the content types registered by plugins in the \"Type\" section as options, or it should not ignore them in the query.",

When the page is short or the viewing window is tall/wide, this won't work as the view cannot be scrolled sufficiently low. When there is a high density of anchors or multiple on the same line this may also be ambiguous (although that could be a separate issue).\n\nSome thoughts of how to make them more visible:\n- Allow anchors to have contents or provide a mechanism to label page elements\n- Have anchors/elements change size/colour when they're the target of browsing (similar to comments)\n\nMotivating reason:\nSome of my users are moving documentation to our wiki and trying to use it for drafting papers. They want to have pages that contain lists/details of references and then be able to link to them where appropriate.

It just takes me to the start of that page.  So I have to look to the tab where the excerpt came from.  Therefor I may think that the \"link for more info\" took me to the wrong content-page.\n\nFor example:\n\nMy text, My text, My text, My text, My text, My text, My text\nMy textMy textMy textMy textMy textMy textMy textMy text\n\"exerpt text here, exerpt text here, exerpt text here, exerpt text here\nexerpt text hereexerpt text hereexerpt text hereexerpt text here\"\nclick here to visit the original exerpt page\n\nMy text, My text, My text, My text, My text, My text, My text\nMy textMy textMy textMy textMy textMy textMy textMy text\n\n\nYou could have two modes for showing this text-with-link.  One located on the frame of the exerpt.  And one below-end/above-start the exerpt if no frame is used.\n\nYou could also have instead of a \"text with the link\" an option to just use a tiny button ( with the default-text \"info\" or \"?\" or \"more\").",
