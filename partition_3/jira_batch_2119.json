It's documentation says: \"List the related labels for a given set of labels, or for the current page\"\n\nI understand related labels as following:\nThe relation between labels exist since they are attached on the same page describing either a topic (e.g. quality, improvement, software_confluence, ...) or a type (issue, meeting-note, abbreviation, security-bulletin, ...) There is no hierarchie so that's the only relation implicitly given. If I enter one or multiple labels into the macro parameter then I expect to see all labels that are attached to all pages carrying this one/these multiple stated label.\nThe current output is designed with a different understanding so it actually works correct to your concept. BUT it has operational weaknesses!\nHow it works now:\nSELECT all labels FROM all pages WHERE pages have ('label1' OR 'label2' OR ...)\nHow it should work:\nSELECT all labels FROM all pages WHERE pages have ('label1' AND 'label2' AND ...)\n\nThis has to be understood:\n* With 'OR' one gets all occurances of labels. If one enters more labels the list increases. This functionality therefore gets less useful the more content develops. That's why I suppose this macro to be rarely used (check it in your cloud and state the result, I'm highly interested): It deliveres too much lables increasingly related to the amount of content.\n* With 'AND' the number of labels decreases with every added label. Principle: reduce to the max. with potential for fuzzy topic-based search.\n\nHow to improve:\n# output related labels of pages containing all stated labels using 'AND' in the select statement. One can decrease the amount of labels using more labels in the parameter and then reduce this amount again with another label and so on.\n# Allow choice of outputting 'list' or 'heatmap'. The heatmap indicates with it's size another information useful for searching.\n# Allow choice of space (empty=all spaces, @self=current space, one or more spaces). That enables space navigation or topic-oriented navigation within a wikipage itself.\n# if one clicks on one of these labels then without page reload the new label cloud is delivered and the selected label is shown in a separat list of 'selected labels' as well as the number of (visible) content items that contain all selected labels. If the user clicks on the number of content items then these are displayed for him to choose (which then actually can be connected with a page reload).\n\nRecommendation: This macro should be used in the space navigation as an option to the page tree and on the site-search (if you adapt these suggestions one can use it also as a better topic navigation). When you click a label the label heatmap reloads and the labels shown are dependent on the label(s) clicked before. If one has the interesting labels then he receives the result pages. We can have a conference to talk about that idea in detail.\n\nWith this you'll lift label usage. I am sure! And this will work better with increasing page count within a space since the hierarchies weaknesses grow with the size of a space! Prepare for the future.",

BUT it has operational weaknesses!\nHow it works now:\nSELECT all labels FROM all pages WHERE pages have ('label1' OR 'label2' OR ...)\nHow it should work:\nSELECT all labels FROM all pages WHERE pages have ('label1' AND 'label2' AND ...)\n\nThis has to be understood:\n* With 'OR' one gets all occurances of labels. If one enters more labels the list increases. This functionality therefore gets less useful the more content develops. That's why I suppose this macro to be rarely used (check it in your cloud and state the result, I'm highly interested): It deliveres too much lables increasingly related to the amount of content.\n* With 'AND' the number of labels decreases with every added label. Principle: reduce to the max. with potential for fuzzy topic-based search.\n\nHow to improve:\n# output related labels of pages containing all stated labels using 'AND' in the select statement. One can decrease the amount of labels using more labels in the parameter and then reduce this amount again with another label and so on.\n# Allow choice of outputting 'list' or 'heatmap'. The heatmap indicates with it's size another information useful for searching.\n# Allow choice of space (empty=all spaces, @self=current space, one or more spaces). That enables space navigation or topic-oriented navigation within a wikipage itself.\n# if one clicks on one of these labels then without page reload the new label cloud is delivered and the selected label is shown in a separat list of 'selected labels' as well as the number of (visible) content items that contain all selected labels. If the user clicks on the number of content items then these are displayed for him to choose (which then actually can be connected with a page reload).\n\nRecommendation: This macro should be used in the space navigation as an option to the page tree and on the site-search (if you adapt these suggestions one can use it also as a better topic navigation). When you click a label the label heatmap reloads and the labels shown are dependent on the label(s) clicked before. If one has the interesting labels then he receives the result pages. We can have a conference to talk about that idea in detail.\n\nWith this you'll lift label usage. I am sure! And this will work better with increasing page count within a space since the hierarchies weaknesses grow with the size of a space! Prepare for the future.",

When I adjust the width of the browser, the excess scrollbar usually disappears.\n\nIssue found in version 5.8.4. \n(Your \"Affects Version/s) does not have this version yet selectable.)\n\nI have not tested this behavior in other browsers than Firefox.",

[See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-37825].\n  {panel}\n\nI have received 3 emails so far for new users and for the third one - Awesome Confluence Features and when you click on the link for Get Started it takes you to https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Confluence+101?utm_source=eval-email&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=confluence-server-day-3  and on this page it says Confluence 101 Page Deleted.  A page with this title has been deleted.  Contact your space administrator if you would like it restored.  I just checked the previous email as well for Learn to master Confluence which takes you to https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Sharing+Content?utm_source=eval-email&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=confluence-server-day-2  and it states on this page Page Not Found.  But does state that possibly the page was renamed to Collaboration which does indeed have information on Sharing Links in looking at the In other Spaces it lists older version of Sharing Content but I guess there isn't anything for the newest version. The information for Collaboration does appear to be the same as for Sharing so this one is somewhat OK and I can get the info needed.\n\nThen went and checked the first one for your Welcome Kit and this one does resolve to the Getting Started with Confluence page at https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Getting+Started+with+Confluence?utm_source=eval-email&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=confluence-server-day-1 - so at least one of them works, one mainly works but would be better if your link took you directly to the new Collaboration page and one of the links either had the content deleted by someone or possibly put somewhere else.  I am able to get to Confluence 101 via the Confluence Document home so that appears to be OK.\n\nSo either you need to clean up the emails you send to users to point to new locations for your documents or update your documentation.  Either way, this is not a good impression with users if this is their first experience with your tools.\n\n",

We moved 6 pages (a parent page and 5 children) from one space to another space, Then the source space was archived These actions were performed successfully. The problem is that other 6 pages (presumably in the source space, have disappeared). They cannot be found in the trash or anywhere else in Confluence. We don't really know how this happened and we do not know how a number of pages can disappear from Confluence without leaving any trace. We suspect this had to do with moving pages from one space to another, but we are not really sure.\n\nThe pages contained quite a lot of content and attachments (images).\n\nWe are using Confluence Cloud.\n ",

Currently preview mode does not have a built-in option to Print - and if you try to use the Print functionality built into the browser, what shows up in the preview or gets printed is browser dependent - but definitely not what the user is trying to print.  Depending on the browser, it may contain most or all of the page and little or none of the attachment content that the user is trying to print.  \n\nThe current workaround is to download the file, open it on your desktop, and then print - but this is awkward and not what users are used to - especially with content like PDFs that browsers normally handle quite well as far as displaying and printing the file directly in the browser.",

Problem\nCurrently Confluence allows to disable including the contents of a watched (and changed) page in the notification emails on a per-user basis (setting it for themselves): [https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Email+Notifications].\n\nAlternatively you can disable the function globally: [https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CONFKB/How+to+Globally+Disable+E-mail+Notifications+with+Page+Content].\n\nIn certain cases, such pages may have content that are not to be sent over e-mail, but watchers (may) still receive it.\n\nh4. Proposal\nProvide the option to disable sending the changed content of a page on a per-page or per-space basis.\n\nh4.

Problem Definition\nAs of now in Confluence, the default decorators are stored and loaded from {{<Confluence-Installation>/confluence/decorators}} folder in the installation directory. Should the admin apply their custom layouts by modifying the files on this folder and not from the {{http://<ServerBaseURL>/admin/listdecorators.action}} page on the admin UI page, Confluence will then take these custom changes and indicate it as a {{default}} layout instead. \n\nDocumentation Reference: https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Customising+Site+and+Space+Layouts#CustomisingSiteandSpaceLayouts-Advancedcustomisations\n\n\\\\\nh5. Suggested Solution\nAs a suggestion, it might be better if the default decorators files are not stored in the file system to ensure that the default layout decorators are not modified by the users.\n",
