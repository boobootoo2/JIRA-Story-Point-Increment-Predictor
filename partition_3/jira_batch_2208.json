Such a strategy prevents us against having DRAFT pages in our production spaces.  In order to enforce the strategy, we need to be able to track MOVES, so that we check if users put their pages at the right location.\n\nIn their present state, the Watch and Daily Summary e-mails are not helping us much for that purpose.  When a page has been created and modified in the last 24 hours, it appears as CREATED in the Daily Summary e-mail, which is great!  However, if a page was created yesterday, and then completed and moved today in the proper global space, it will only appear as LAST EDITED... in the Daily Summary or in the Watch e-mail subject.\n\nWe DON'T want to monitor every EDITED page, only when they're MOVED.  Is there any way to realize this with the present Confluence versions?  If not, it would be of great help if we could watch MOVED pages in any way (Watch, Daily Summary, RSS Feed or whatever else).\n\nThanks for letting me know if it can be realized now, or else what could be the timeframe within which we could expect this improvement to be done.",

Seems to do ok with the initial import process but then gets off track with the \"apply special processing\" and the portion after that (forget the text).\n\nFor example, after a few minutes the estimate settled down to about 30 minutes and I believe the initial import process completed in about that time.  Then the special processing kicked in and then gradually the estimate kept moving up to about 50-55 minutes total.  Got down to about 1 minute left.  Then after special processing was finished, jumped back up to 6 minutes left.  Total import finished in 59 minutes.\n",

For my particular needs, this would be particularly useful if combined with CONF-3963 which would allow attachments to be labelled.  For example, by labelling certain attachments as a document type, e.g. \"proposal\", you could then search all off the proposals on the site by searching things with that label.  Adding these two capabilities would go a long way towards being able to use Confluence as a better document repository.",

At a company where I am consulting, this doesn't work out right: \n\n 1. Sometimes a user's givenName isn't present, but his/her initials are. These users show up with just their surname.\n\n 2. Typically a Dutch problem: surnames here often consist of a prefix (in my case 'van') and a 'main' surname (Zwetselaar). At this company, the prefix is stored in a separate attribute (snPrefix), and the main surname in the sn attribute. As a consequence, I show up as \"Marco Zwetselaar\" which isn't right either.\n\n 3. Not a problem here, but I guess it would be in other countries, where surname is customarily shown before given name.\n\nThe solution would be if, instead of givenName + sn, the cn attribute would should be shown as the display name of the user. AFAIK, convention ally LDAPs use precisely that attribute to store the full name of the user. \n",

Some less advanced users sometimes create pages with title \"New\nPage\" - believe it or not.  When the title is changed later on, the link\nis broken, see below:\n\nconfluence@riege.com schrieb:\n> >       This is a daily summary of all recent changes in Confluence.\n[..]\n> >     * [New Page] New Page </display/RSIDEV/New+Page> was created by\n> >       X <https://wiki.riege.com/display/~X> - 11:23:08.\n> >\n> > Powered by Atlassian Confluence\n> > <http://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/default.jsp?clicked=footer>\n> > (Version: 2.2.7 Build:#524 Jul 28, 2006) - Bug/feature request\n> > <http://jira.atlassian.com/secure/BrowseProject.jspa?id=10470>\n\nBest regards,\nHeiko",

As opposed to wiki pages (which are versioned and recoverable in case of deletion) important attachments can be lost by deletion when not protected by a restriction at the page level. Moreover, they cannot be recovered from the trash can.\n\nOur company needs to trust Confluence with critical information in the form of attachments. Our users must be able to leave a page unrestricted while relying on Confluence that their attachments will not be deleted by mistake or by the action of another single user without any chance of recovering it. \n\nConfluence needs a special restriction/control over attachments. Currently, it leaves important documentation unprotected/unrecoverable in case of accidental deletion. \n\nThe solution should include a default permission for deletion; a warning message when righfully deleting an attachment; and the ability to recover it from the trash can.",

As a workaround we create a \"Trash\" page in each space that attachments can be moved to for eventual deletion, but this is an unintuituve kludge.\n\nThanks!\n",

When trying to integrate these lists into a nicely laid out page, it ends up a hodgepodge.\n\nIt would be great to be able to ask for a set of pages (e.g. children, recent updates, recent news, etc) and specify the desired list style, possibly including some variations on the number and kinds of columns to show. At a minimum, I'd like to get any page list as an unadorned list so that I can put it in any kind of table, section, under a heading, etc.\n\nFor example:\n\n{children:list-style=plain} - displays an unadorned list\n{children:list-style=table} - displays a table\n{children:list-style=heard} - displays list under a header bar of some sort (like {recently-updated} does)",

Most search engines (like google) consider the period character \".\" to define a break in search tokens so that from an indexing perspective \"appserver28nyc.dbpool.servers.domain.com\" would be considered as 5 seperate tokens appserver28nyc, dbpool, servers, domain, and com. Confluence does not.\n\nAn easy way to see this work in other search engines is by searching for \"192.168\" on any major search engine.\n\nIf you create a page in confluence with the string \"192.168.1.1\" and then search for \"192.168\" you'll get 0 results.\n\nThis would be very useful and would move confluence towards conforming to standard practices in search.",

The behavior is as if your session just \"took over\" another user, without requiring any password whatsoever.\n\nWe have seen this happen to all users, with increasing frequency possibly related to time since Confluence was restarted.  At 20 days uptime we see user sessions morph to other users several times a day.  The morphing can happen in the midst of an active session (e.g., while editing a page or navigating Confluence) or after being idle for 8-10 hours.  It also is independent of various combinations of client OS and browsers: Mac OS X, Linux, MS Windows, Firefox, Safari, Internet Explorer, Camino.\n\nWe have yet to determine conditions to reproduce the behavior at will.  Perhaps integrating user id in the session cookie might be an effective check against unauthorized access.",

Would it be possible to create a restore procedure in the datasource to restore a site?  It seems if the site can be XML encoded, then it could be encoded in the datasource and updated during reindexing.  This way, in the event that Confluence is corrupted, the site could be restored from the datasource and contain the most recent data, rather than data from a backup ran several hours (or even days) earlier.  I think it would be an incredibly useful feature, especially when you consider the potential for environment replication.",

The policy will specify the levels of sensitivity of various types of data/documents and the access controls required for each level. Confluence can already support this using Space and Page level security controls. However, we believe it would be much more convenient to have the ability to apply (pre-defined) access controls according to a document's data classification within a single space. I think this would be similar to the \"issue level\" security in JIRA. ",

The \"command word\" for this is: {toc}\n\nIt would be nice if this could be added to a pulldown in the edit toolbar so users could easily see what extened functionality was available from plugins or macros. In the toolbar it would use a descriptive word such as \"Table of Contents\" and when selected would add \"{toc}\" into the document for them.\n\nOptionally you could create and assign this to a new icon on the edit toolbar instead of a text pulldown.\n\nAlso, it would be nice if the plugin SDK was extended to allow plugins to have an option for adding an icon/pulldown text. If the plugin had this option, it would show up in the admin/plugins panel as maybe checkboxs (\"show icon on edit toolbar\" / choose an icon) and/or (\"show in pulldown\" \\ \"Pulldown text: \").\n\nBeing able to extend the edit toolbar in this way would make editing much easier- and because you will always/ know/remember what functionality is available to you, make better pages in the process.\n",
