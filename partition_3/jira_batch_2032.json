Summary\r\n\r\nWhen including a page (into another page via a third party app) that has a dynamic macro in it, you get a different {{macro.id}} as a context parameter in the descriptor.

There, if you insert a custom JQL that would return only a single issue, and then, change the display from \"Table\" to \"Single\", the same gets converted to a JQL that included only \"KEY = Example\".\r\nh3.
