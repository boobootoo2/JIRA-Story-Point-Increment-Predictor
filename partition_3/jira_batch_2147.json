Ideally, this functionality would be exposed via the REST API so user creation can be further automated. \n* Sub feature is to \"lock\" an avatar and not allow it to be edited by a user.\n* Sub feature is to allow editing of multiple user's avatars at once\n\nCurrent ability to accomplish this happens in one of 2 ways:\n\n1. Use a third party plugin to allow me to SU to a user. Then modify it while logged in as them\n2. Change the users password, log in as them, make the change.

The \"What's New\" iframe can be configured via help-paths.properties to load from https://docs.atlassian.com/ instead of http://docs.atlassian.com/ in an attempt to avoid this. However, that doesn't achieve much since the \"What's New\" destination page then does a redirect to non-SSL page located under http://www.atlassian.com/ which then attempts to redirect to https://www.atlassian.com/\n\nBecause the insecure redirect is blocked, the user gets an empty white box for the \"What's New\" feature or if they are lucky an error message saying the content couldn't be loaded. Some browsers will prompt the user asking if they would like to permit mixed content, others will not.\n\nIt seems clear to me that the redirect setup from https://docs.atlassian.com/ should go straight to the secure https://www.atlassian.com/ site since that's where the content is ultimately hosted anyway.\n\nI don't want to host Confluence help locally and I'm not even sure that would include \"What's New\" notices anyway. The only feasible workaround I could come up with was to disable \"What's New\" notices, which is rather unfortunate.\n\nTo reproduce, visit the first URL and inspect the HTTP requests with Tamper Data or Fiddler:\nhttps://docs.atlassian.com/confluence/docs-52/whatsnew/iframe\nhttp://www.atlassian.com/en/software/confluence/whats-new-iframe/52\nhttps://www.atlassian.com/en/software/confluence/whats-new-iframe/52\n",

Resolution for Cloud instances\nThe Confluence Cloud importer has been updated to provide a *_JIRA macro repair_* feature, in which any broken JIRA macros will be fixed as part of the import.\nFor more details on this, please refer to our [Import the space content into Confluence Cloud|https://confluence.atlassian.com/confcloud/import-a-confluence-space-724765531.html#ImportaConfluenceSpace-Step3.ImportthespacecontentintoConfluenceCloud] document.\nh4. Workaround for Server instances\nIf you're using Confluence Server and you've recently changed domain name, migrated from Confluence Cloud, or merged multiple instances, you may need to relink JIRA issues macros.\nFor a workaround of this issue, please refer to the steps outlined in our [How to bulk update JIRA Issue Macro to point to a different JIRA instance|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CONFKB/How+to+bulk+update+JIRA+Issue+Macro+to+point+to+a+different+JIRA+instance]\n{panel}\nh3.

Create an applink to a JIRA instance\n2. Create an issue in JIRA, e.g. TP-1\n3. Edit a Confluence page and insert the issue using wiki-markup, e.g. {jira:TP-1}\n4. Save the page and check that the macro renders correctly (it should)\n5. Check the JIRA issue for linked pages (there will be no linked pages)\n\nThis behaviour is inconsistent with what happens when the issue is inserted via the JIRA Issues macro dialog, which properly creates a remote link to JIRA.",

However, Jira appears to be able to use gmail as a mail server without jumping through these same hoops and it all can be completed in the Jira admin UI.  Bringing this same functionality to Confluence would be of great help and is highly requested as can be seen in the comments section of the following page.\n\n* [How Do I Configure Confluence to Use GMail as the Mail Server?|https://confluence.atlassian.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=42795030]",
