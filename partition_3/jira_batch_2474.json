I finally made the repository private to stop the flood about twenty minutes ago. At that time I was receiving about ten emails from Bitbucket per minute, and Bitbucket was sending me so many emails so quickly that about twenty minutes after making the repository private, then removing its issue tracker, then unsubscribing to notifications from the repository, I am _still_ having straggling emails from bitbucket show up in my gmail.\n\nI know that Atlassian is aware of the current spam attacks on BitBucket, and I know that the spam is not your fault. _However_, I think your software should be aware that if it is sending someone nearly a thousand emails in a day! \u2014 or ten in a minute\u2014! Something is wrong. The spam attacks are not your fault but your software has reacted to the spam attacks very poorly.\n\nI would like to suggest BitBucket add some combination of the following features:\n\n* Some sort of flood detection where if you send more than a certain number of notification emails to a user over some reasonable amount of time, the emails either cut off or begin getting batched into several notifications per email.\n* A batch mode where instead of sending one email per notification, you send one email per day with all notifications. Or one per hour? One per fifteen minutes?\n\nI do not want to turn off email notifications from Bitbucket because the email notifications on my repositories are useful. But my personal email has been completely unusuable for days due to the spam attacks. If you cannot get things under control somehow I will have to cut off Bitbucket from sending me email :(",

However as described in issue BCLOUD-12624 I saw a spammer begin to attempt to use my wiki pages to host spam, so I have had to make the wikis private-edit. This is too bad because now it means users cannot help with the documentation any more.\n\nThe wikis are backed by mercurial and can be checked out and edited using mercurial. I would like to request that it be possible for a user to pull-request changes to wikis, so that users can still help with the wiki without the risk of defacement or spam possible. Currently you cannot fork a wiki and there&#x27;s no way to use the pull request feature with a wiki.\n\nI would like to note GitHub already offers this feature (because their equivalent of the public wikis is the gh-pages branch which the existing pull request feature can be used with).",

      "description": "I have a couple of repositories hosted on bit bucket with wikis. Here is an example:\\\\\nhttps://bitbucket.org/runhello/jumpcore/wiki/Home\\\\\nUp until a few minutes ago, the wiki for this site was public editable-- any bitbucket account could edit it.\n\nA few minutes ago, a spammer created a junk page (they have also been hitting my issues and bitbucket technical support is already assisting me) named \"(Delaware) (((1800+[snip])) QuickBooks Pro Support Phone Number .md\" on the wiki. I quickly noticed, deleted their page and turned off public edits.\n\nHowever because of this i noticed something. Their edits are forever in my wiki edit history. If I check out the hg backed repository, I can see in {{hg glog --style=compact}}:\n\n{code}\n@  38[tip]   283c3d2d2c61   2016-04-22 21:13 +0000   runhello <REDACTED>\n|    Removed files via bitbucket\n|\no  37   7fb6101a5bc1   2016-04-22 21:11 +0000   makbaldwin1 <makbaldwin1@usa-11.com>\n|    Edited online\n|\no  36   6fda7925433a   2014-10-06 15:34 +0000   runhello <REDACTED>\n|    Edited online\n{code}\n\nThe {{makbaldwin1}} edit is the bad one. I can still see its full contents using hg.\n\nBecause this is only one commit with one page, and it is just spam, this is not harmful. However I think this shows a feature limitation you should fix. Imagine: What if the edit had been harmful, for example posting someone&#x27;s personal information? Then I would be stuck hosting that edit in the history of my bitbucket site forever. Or what if instead of one commit, it had been 400? Then the usefulness of my wiki would be restricted, because I would have to deal with those 400 commits every time I tried to edit my wiki using the mercurial interface.\n\nA thing I notice: If this were a git repository and the wiki were backed by git, I could delete history from the wiki using {{git push -f}}. Similarly, if this were a source repository instead of a wiki-repository I could delete history in an emergency using the \"strip changeset\" feature. The \"strip changeset\" feature does not work for the wiki.\n\nI think \"strip changeset\" should be available for hg-backed wikis.",

It appears exactly two of them are legitimate issues posted by a user. The others are commercial spam, consisting of garbled names of commercial products and 800 numbers. The posts come from many different account names but the text is roughly the same for each. A nice person from Atlassian spoke to me last night on Twitter and deleted about 50 of these spam comments, but then at 1:30 PM today whoever is posting these increased their rate to about two per minute, leading to several hundred spam issues in a matter of three hours. I have turned off public issue posting in response.\n\nHowever, now I have 481 spam comments in my queue. It takes about four clicks to report a single issue as spam, so that is about 1600 clicks and I do not know how much time to report all of them. I cannot do this.\n\nBecause your issue interface is a target for spam and has been for some time, I believe you need a mass delete / mass report feature. I do not know what this would look like, but both gmail and wordpress have features where there is a checkbox next to each post on a page, and you can \"check all\", uncheck the one or two legitimate posts, then \"report/delete all\".\n\nThanks.",

Request Feature 1\nAdd a setting in the repository settings toggle on/off: {{Limit Tagged users to Private Repository Members}} which would prevent anyone who isn&#x27;t a part of that repository from appearing in the autocomplete list.\n\nFor example if you type {{@bil}} as you can see in my screenshot below, it will not show {{@bil}} as an option, it would only show {{@bil_bas}}. Default Repository Setting: False (off)\n\n!http://i.imgur.com/ftNmiMD.png!\n\nIn regards to my first suggestion, the support staff said this is slightly different to what has been requested over at: BCLOUD-6092\n\nTo me it looks like it was \"fixed\" BCLOUD-6672 but clearly in my screenshot it&#x27;s not working.\n\n----\nh1. Request Feature 2\nAdd a page in the repository settings for {{Tagging Alias&#x27;s}}, this would allow you to set any/multiple \"tag\" phrases to automatically convert to tag a specific user. It would be good to allow the \"tag\" alias to allow regex too for more advanced users who want to cover various names with 1 rule.\n\nFor example, it would allow you to setup: {{@Bil}} as an alias of {{@bil_bas}}. Now when you type {{@Bil}} and submit a post (even in public repositories) this *would not tag* the user behind {{@bil}} instead it would override and tag {{@bil_bas}}\n\nThis could allow people to also setup alias&#x27;s like: {{@core}} which would tag the manager/lead \"core\" developer instead of having to type their @username.\n\n----\nNote: This falls under usability, repository administration and even teams. I filed it as usability because it&#x27;s a pain tagging the wrong user over and over again when the person(s) I tag aren&#x27;t even a member of my repository.\n\nThanks",

However the default in bitbucket is to open the pull request against the master fork.\n\nThat&#x27;s quite a logical default but is very annoying when it cannot be modified.\n\nTherefore my request is to add a setting to set the default project for opening pull requests against.\n\nTangentially related to my previous request, BCLOUD-11283 (BB-13552)",

This will greatly help in actually enforcing successful tests before something is deployed to a production branch.\n\nNote that this might be more complicated than it first looks. I do not want it to just be rejected if there is a failed build, because if I have multiple build configurations configured for a branch and not all of them have completed, the lack of failure doesn&#x27;t mean anything. In other words, the ideal solution would be specifying the names (or IDs) of build configurations that explicitly have to finish with a successful state before merging is possible.\n\nThis should of course always be enforced on the latest commit in a pull request. If a previous commit had all successful builds but there is a new commit that is awaiting new builds, the entire pull request is currently still marked as successful, which isn&#x27;t technically correct. Especially for this use case, the enforcement should always happen on the latest commit (since that is the state that matters for merging).",
