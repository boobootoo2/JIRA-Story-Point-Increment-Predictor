We'd love to hear from you if you are able to provide any more context on this topic. Your feedback will go a long way to helping shape the roadmap and solutions we build.\r\n\r\nIf you're interested, please email esaboia@atlassian.com and I'll schedule a quick chat with you.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n Eric Saboia\r\nAtlassian\r\n{panel}\r\nUser records in LDAP typically have a lot of information associated with them:\r\n - telephone numbers\r\n - addresses\r\n - pictures\r\n\r\nIt would be good if Confluence could use this information for:\r\n - displaying in user profile page\r\n - displaying in people directory (2.3+)\r\n\r\nI believe this requires a few changes to Atlassian User to implement.",

This compatibility wrapper sets an attachment path in the render context which, once set, becomes fixed for the entire page render. Our embedded image renderer checks this context path and uses it without question once a value has been set. As the compatibility macro sets the path to be the attachment path for the current page, it breaks embedded images from other pages. In essence any macro that implements org.radeox.macro.Macro will break images embedded from other pages.\n\nWe don't want to \"fix\" this behaviour as doing so would affect all macros that implement this interface and we would recommend that macros now implement the com.atlassian.renderer.v2.macro.Macro interface instead.\n\nIn light of this we should migrate the macros that confluence ships with to use the new interface as well.",

This is fine for a standalone client code/script, but if you want to make use of xml-rpc in a php served web page that just needs to check that you are logged in, and pull back your username, there is no way to access the token. The login token should be available via the seraph.confluence cookie.  Also, it would be great if this cookie had a configurable path/realm so that you can choose to expose it to the rest of your site.\n\ne.g. If I have a site as  http://mywebspace/. and confluence is setup as  http://mywebspace/wiki/  then the cookie will only be pathed to /wiki and not /\n\nThere appears to be no ability to configu to expose the confluence user session cookie data to a larger cookie realm. This would be nice as it would allow for development off a single-sign-on environment where the core of that SSO is confluence's existing session management.\n\nIn the past there was a bug fix to restrict the cookie path to the context path of confluence to ensure that the cookies don't colide with JIRA and other Seraph authenticating web applications. This was a good fix, but it's ultimatly removed the ability to pass the cookie to a PHP coded page, that could decode the cookie, get the authentication token, and use that via the XML-RPC or Soap Remote API to perform tasks knowing the use it logged in.\n\nThere are plenty of examples on writting my own single sign on code, but why go to that effort when the framwork is in place within confluence itself, I just need to be able to talk to it.\n\nI'd like to see the authentication token, stored into the cookie, to be able to configure the cookie to default to the context path, but allow for this to be set as '/'. \n\nUnless there is a way to configure this, but it's just buried somewhere in the config files. I haven't had much success finding it as yet.\n\nAny ideas, could the previous bug fixes be modified to make it a little more admin-configurable?\n",

Since Confluence does not use HTTP BASIC authentication there is no record in the access log of what authenticated user is associated with an individual HTTP request.   For logging in general we need an understanding of all the logging options for Confluence which can produce log records. \n\n3) How can we lock out users after three unsuccessful login attempts (i.e. brute force attack)? \n\n4) How can we apply password policy controls (expiration, minimum length, re-use,...)? \n\nFor life cycle management, I have included two examples in which meta-tags were used. \n  \nExample 1 - what we used for the policy driven lifecycle meta-tags in HTML pages \n\n  <meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\"> \n   <meta name=\"title\" content=\"Apache Web Server\"> \n   <meta name=\"description\" content=\"Apache Web Server\"> \n   <meta name=\"creator\" content=\"John P.

Such 'island' pages (isolated wiki pages with no visibility into the space beyond/no birds-eye view on the wiki) can be shared within a team/community/group of users (by sharing the URL) without having to share the whole space with everyone at once/the same time (unlike personal space pages).  Rely on word-of-mouth interlinking to other pages in the space, for making pages accessible from each other only within some kind of context (vs. cold search results).  \n\nBenefits:\n- Allows topics to emerge on one or more related pages ('islands') before moving out of the incubator into a relevant \"traditional\" (and searchable) team space.\n- Encourages interlinking between pages which are related (results in better inter-page browseability and provides more metadata for search relevance and \"related pages\" functionality - once the content moves to a searchable space).\n- Encourages using red (undefined) links to first map out future related/children pages (i.e. top-down mental process).\n- Allows unrelated pages to remain invisible to each other within the same space, in turn allowing to share a page (and those it links to) without necessarily sharing the whole space.  This can also reduce the overall number of spaces required.\n\nOf course Space admins would still have god-like browse and search access to everything, and 'Browse & Search' would be ON by default to keep current standard behavior.\n\nI know it sounds contrary to wiki philosophy to wish to restrict page browsing (i.e. content discovery) but as mentioned above, it can make sense in some cases.\n\nNote: Comparable functionality is available in Picasa Web albums: one can elect to make a photo gallery public (visible on the user's public gallery index page) or private (gallery still publicly accessible without logging in, but URL obfuscated so it's hard to guess and virtually impossible to randomly discover).  The key is obscurity (content hard to find unless you've received a link to it), not restriction (i.e. read/write permissioning unaffected).",

Sometimes, it is necessary to have an up to do exported version of the space pages and attachments.\n\ne.g. We store Disaster Recovery documentation as Confluence pages - if there is a disaster, Confluence is unlikely to be available. Rather than having to have a copy of Confluence available on support PCs and daily backups of the entire site copied across (which can be very large), it would be much better to be able to schedule exports of particular spaces.\n\nAlternatively, the auto-export plugin [http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CONFEXT/AutoExport+for+Confluence] makes a good start on this, but seems to be no longer supported, and is very buggy, and restrictred to HTML. It would be fantastic if this was a supported, standard feature in Confluence.",

We already evaluated http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CONFEXT/Advanced+Search+Plugin but this isn't what we're looking for.\n\nWe need several improvements of the current search:\n- searching a subtree within a space (a single page and recursivly all it's childrens)\n- searching for a specific time period. (not just last X days, but something like \"from 10-10-2006 to 10-12-2006\"\n\nAny hint appreciated.\nRegards\nMarkus\n",

This is different than issue CONF-3701 which talks about restricting permissions.\n\nIn many instances customers have offered a scenario where they have a somewhat restricted space but want to open up individual pages to a larger audience. For instance a technical team might want to open up a specification page to a larger audience, but don't want to open up everything and don't want to create a new space just for the spec. page. \n\nThis might be similar to a scaled down version of the process by which users and groups are given access to view and edit spaces....though this feature would be just for individual pages with the control most likely being offered on the page itself, as with the ability to restrict access.\n\nThis is a related issue, though not clearly defined: CONF-5682\n\nThere is also the case where a page needs to be open to viewing by anonymous users in a space which is otherwise inaccessible. If this issue were implemented, the UI should allow permitting anonymous access. (This was originally raised as CONF-10316.)",

For a few dozen pages this took days. For various reasons, my organization decided to put off switching until later, if ever, when we will have even more content in MediaWiki at which time the process will be even harder.  We probably will never convert as a result.\n\nThe right architectural solution to this, I suggest, might be to store the pages as HTML and to provide plug-in converters to-from Confluence markup and MediaWiki markup. Import/export specifies which dialect to use, and each user specifies their preference for dialect.\n\nThis architecture would solve the conversion problem: you simply designate that the files being imported are marked up with MediaWiki formatting. And it would solve the user problem: users already fluent in MediaWiki markup need never switch to Confluence markup.",

These are no longer dynamic.\n\nIt would be excellent to be able to use a {children:unique=true} or {children:unlinked=true} or something like that to specify I would like to make a summary list of all children of this page which are *NOT OTHERWISE LINKED* from this page. That way, you could make a static list:\n\n[my child page one|some page name]\n[my child page three]\n[my child page two]\n{children:unlinked=true}\n\nwhich would list in an arbitrary manner the indexed sub-pages, but would also be dynamically extensible.\n\nThanks",

So it is not possible to run the \"recommended\" repository-plugin.\n\nFor example, some tools like Maven allow to connect to a Mirror of a repository. This Mirror could be hostet in the intranet and the client could connect to it, to work like now.\n\nOr the client could be fed with a summary-list to check the local plugins whether they are up to date. Then they could be downloaded manualy without checking each single one.\n\nOr the client could work offline, to browse just through a detailed plugin-table.\n\ncheers\nFrank",
