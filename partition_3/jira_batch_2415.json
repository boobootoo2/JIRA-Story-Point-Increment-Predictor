The rep handling that request suggested that I file this here.\n\n--- Original issue:\n\n{code}\nThis may be an \"as expected\" race condition, but is still annoying/distracting. The rough steps to reproduce are:\n\n1. Have a default pipelines configuration that catches all branches.\n2. Have a PR on some branch X that triggers this default pipeline.\n3. Push some final changes to branch X. This triggers a pipeline execution (as expected).\n4. Before the pipeline in step 3 actually starts, merge the PR with \"delete branch X\" selected. This is the race condition.\n5. Note that the pipeline in step 3 errors out with something like \"fatal: Remote branch X not found in upstream origin\"\n\nPossible resolutions:\n\n1. Cancel any pipelines running on branch X when branch X is deleted. This would still probably have a race condition if the cancel doesn&#x27;t happen before the error is triggered.\n2. Don&#x27;t let users merge and delete branch X while there are pipelines for branch X still running / scheduled.\n3. Queue the merge to happen later after all the pending pipelines have (successfully?) completed.\n{code}",

The custom cache setup broke. A container spawned from a {{docker run}} command in a step can write to the _host_ folder, but when you enable the custom cache definition it breaks due to permissions.\n\nYou can find the minimum failing test case in this repository:\n\n* [https://bitbucket.org/magnet-coop/pipeline-cache-debug|https://bitbucket.org/magnet-coop/pipeline-cache-debug]\n\nWe hadn\u2019t change anything since last November in that repository, when we originally produced the failing test case. We simply rerun pipeline build [#32|https://bitbucket.org/magnet-coop/pipeline-cache-debug/addon/pipelines/home#%21/results/32] (the one that run successfully, after your team rolled out a change to fix the problem at that time). That rerun (build [#33|https://bitbucket.org/magnet-coop/pipeline-cache-debug/addon/pipelines/home#%21/results/33]) failed with exactly the same symptoms that we had last November. After changing the {{docker run [...]}} command not to mount the custom cache, it built successfully (build [#35|https://bitbucket.org/magnet-coop/pipeline-cache-debug/addon/pipelines/home#%21/results/35]).\n\nWe\u2019ve had to disable custom caches for maven artifacts in all of our pipelines to be able to keep them working!\n\nAgain this was totally unexpected! After last November incident, we have been been monitoring the pages where changes to Pipelines are posted  and nothing related to this behavior change as been announced anywhere!\n\nPlease, could you warn your customers before any of those changes?

This pull request had a passing build, but my colleague pushed new code to the remote branch during the service outage (which triggered a new build but left in a pending state for quite some time, due to the service outage). This should&#x27;ve invalidated the last build result but my colleague was then able to merge the pull request without a fresh build: he accidentally got around the passing build requirement.\n\nIt appears that a failure in invalidating build results is \"fail-deadly\" - I&#x27;d&#x27;ve expected the pull request&#x27;s build status to be immediately invalid as soon as there are any new commits. In theory, Bitbucket has all the information to prevent this in the event that CircleCI does not respond with an up-to-date job status: it knows the latest commit, and if it stores the commit alongside the latest passing build job it triggered, it can immediately prevent merge of the pull request if these don\u2019t match.\n\nIncident happened on 10 April.",
