      "description": "Currently when planning a sprint, dragging the sprint bar adds issues to the new sprint according to the order the issues are shown. If I have 40 issues and drag the bar down by 10, I get 10 issues in the new sprint and 30 outside. Dragging individual issues around lets me change this.\r\nHowever, when using filters, the plan mode does exactly the same - namely _showing_ 15 total filtered issues while there are _actually_ 40 issues. Dragging the bar down by 10 adds _at least_ 10 issues, and depending on the filter it may add up to 35 because the bar still adds them according to their order and not according to their *visible* order.\r\n\r\nAnd this is the main reason we cannot really use the Rapid Board, being stuck with the old Classic Boards.\r\n\r\nUsing the Epic or Version filter for example, we get the planned issues for the version and want to divide them into smaller sprints. Doing that however not only adds issue of the selected Version/Epic, but also ones that are merely hidden by the filter.",
