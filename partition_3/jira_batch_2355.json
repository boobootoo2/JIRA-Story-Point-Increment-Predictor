Summary\r\nWhen you have a proxy required to access to Stash (ngnx, apache, etc) but you also must define a different corporate proxy to access the internet (for the Marketplace) by adding the corporate proxy details to JVM_SUPPORT_RECOMMENDED_ARGS variable in /bin/setenv.sh this causes Application links to fail.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Duplicate\r\n- Setup Stash to work with a proxy (http/https don't seem to be a factor)  Users point to address http://stash.company.com which is the Proxy that forwards request to http://stashserver:7990.  This works fine and Application Links are able to be created without issue but if you require a Proxy to gain access to the internet the Marketplace will not function\r\n- Edit setenv.sh and add the following to the JVM_SUPPORT_RECOMMENDED_ARGS\r\n{code}\r\n-Dhttp.proxyHost=proxy.host \r\n-Dhttp.proxyPort=80 \r\n-Dhttp.nonProxyHost=localhost\\|*.internaladdress.com \r\n-Dhttps.proxyHost=proxy.host \r\n-Dhttps.proxyPort=80\r\n{code}\r\n- Restart Stash\r\n- Now the Marketplace is available but all of the application links fail.\r\n- Edit setenv.sh, remove any proxy related options from the JVM_SUPPORT_RECOMMENDED_ARGS variable in /bin/setenv.sh\r\n- While still in setenv.sh, scroll down to the JAVA_OPTS= variable\r\n-- In the JAVA_OPTS variable add the Java proxy options before the end quote\r\n- Restart Stash\r\n- Now the Marketplace is still available but all of the application links fail\r\n- Edit setenv.sh, remove any references to the corporate proxy for accessing the internet from the JVM_SUPPORT_RECOMMENDED_ARGS  and the  JAVA_OPTS\r\n- Restart Stash\r\n- Now the Application links work but access to the Marketplace understandably does not work because the Stash server has no access to the Internet.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Behavior\r\nStash should be able to work with an internal proxy\\reverse proxy that manages traffic to the Stash Server and Stash should be able to simultaneously be able to communicate with the Internet using an established corporate proxy that is most likely not the same proxy.",

The new page has fast and smooth scrolling on pull requests of any size, which adds comfort to your code review experience.\r\n\r\nYou can find more information in the Bitbucket Server 7.0\u00a0[release notes|https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/bitbucket-server-7-0-release-notes-990546638.html] and Pull Requests [documentation|https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/review-and-discuss-a-pull-request-808488540.html].\r\n\r\nPlease, don't hesitate to leave feedback on the feature in the comments. This will help us to priorities further development.\r\n\r\nAnton Genkin\r\n Product Manager Bitbucket Server\r\n{panel}\r\n*Original message*\r\n\r\nCurrently, if diff is wide and long, I have to scroll to the bottom to use the bottom scrollbar, then scroll back up to see what I wanted to see. (I think the side scrollbar belongs to the browser (in this case Chrome) and Stash only has the bottom bar.) It would be much nicer to have both scrollbars visible and to be able to navigate within that. (Same for file list view.)",

But for some types of projects, this is not reasonable or even practical. Multiple revisions of a large file take up space quickly, slowing down repository operations and making fetches unwieldy.\r\n\r\nGit LFS overcomes this limitation by storing the metadata for large files in Git and syncing the file contents to a configurable [Git LFS server|https://github.com/github/git-lfs/blob/master/docs/api.md]. Some of the key features include:\r\n\r\n* Tight integration with Git means you don't have to change your workflow after the initial configuration.\r\n* Large files are synced separately to a configurable Git LFS server over HTTPS, so you are not limited in where you push your Git repository.\r\n* Large files are only synced from the server when they are checked out, so your local repository doesn't carry the weight of every version of every file when it is not needed.\r\n* The meta data stored in Git is extensible for future use. It currently includes a hash of the contents of the file, and the file size so clients can display a progress bar while downloading or opt out of a large download.\r\n* Clients and servers can make use of all the features of HTTPS, such as caching content locally on a CDN, resumable uploads and downloads, or performing requests in parallel for faster transfers.\r\n\r\n*+More Info+:* https://git-lfs.github.com/\r\n*+Source Code+:* https://github.com/github/git-lfs",

I check the account of another admin and they also had a pile of SSH keys with the same label (from the Bamboo plans they had created).\r\n\r\nIs this expected behaviour?

It's been a long wait, but I have\u00a0good news for you. In\u00a0[Bitbucket Server 7.13|https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/bitbucket-data-center-and-server-7-13-release-notes-1056675425.html#BitbucketDataCenterandServer7.13releasenotes-brm] we have released [Advanced repository management|https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/advanced-repository-management-1064084889.html]. This feature helps to get a holistic view on all repositories in Bitbucket. It can help you find all orphaned repositories in just a few clicks. Select _Personal (deleted users)_ option in _Repositories type_ filter.\r\n\r\nNote: We will add Repository size filter soon, so that figuring out which orphaned repositories occupy the most disk space will be easy.\r\n\r\nTo learn more about new features of Bitbucket Data Center 7.13 read the\u00a0[release notes|https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/bitbucket-data-center-and-server-7-13-release-notes-1056675425.html].\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n Anton Genkin - Product Manager \r\n Bitbucket Data Center\r\n{panel}\r\n*Original message*\r\nh3. Summary\r\n\r\nFrom [this post in Answers|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/249540/how-do-you-find-orphaned-repositories-in-stash] we found a use case in which users that are removed from Stash or deactivated in an external User Directory might leave orphan personal repositories behind that are not accessible from the UI.\r\n\r\nWe should offer sysadmins a way to view these orphaned personal repositories so they can be managed.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nHere is the scenario. I, the administrator, create a user. The user logs in and creates some repositories and only gives himself/herself access to said repositories.\r\n The user is now fired and the administrator (actually the LDAP synchronization task) removes the user from Stash. How does the administrator find all of the repositories that the user created?\r\n When I run this test, the repositories just seem to disappear. I have to know the names of the repositories to search for them and then I can add a new owner or delete them.\r\n I work for a large organization and this scenario could lead to many orphaned repositories, because the administrator is not privy to every employee departure and certainly would not know what repositories were created by the user.\r\n\r\n*Scenario 1: Internal Database*\r\n # Create a user in the Stash Internal Database\r\n # Add at least [Global permissions to it|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/STASH/Global+permissions]\r\n # Log in as the newly created user\r\n # Go to its profile and create a personal repo\r\n # As an admin user, delete the user\r\n # You will have created an orphan repo\r\n\r\n*Scenario 2: External Directory*\r\n # Create a user in the External Directory you've got (i.e. LDAP, Crowd or JIRA)\r\n # Add at least [Global permissions to it|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/STASH/Global+permissions]\r\n # Log in as the newly created user\r\n # Go to its profile and create a personal repo\r\n # As an admin of the User Directory, de-activate the user\r\n # You will have created an orphan repo\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe repo will still be there, but the Stash administrator will have a way to easily find repos on that situation.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe repo will still be there, but the Stash administrator will have a way to easily find repos on that situation.\r\n\r\nThis ties back to STASH-3564 as there should be a better way to visualize/browse personal repositories\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nYou will be able to find the orphan users/repos if you run the query below against your database:\r\n{code:java}\r\nselect snu.name, r.slug from sta_personal_project spr, repository r, sta_normal_user snu\r\nwhere spr.project_id=r.project_id and spr.owner_id=snu.user_id \r\nand snu.name not in \r\n(select u.lower_user_name \r\nfrom cwd_user u join cwd_directory d on u.directory_id = d.id \r\nwhere d.is_active='T' and u.is_active='T');\r\n{code}\r\n*Important:* do not change anything on your database. With the information above, as a Stash administrator, you will be able to hit the orphan profile page of that user and remove its repo. You will have to browse straight into their profile page by hitting the following URL:\r\n{noformat}\r\nhttp://<Stash_URL>/users/<username_from_query_above>\r\n{noformat}\r\nOn this page you will be able to see all the user's orphan repos. From there, you can browse into the repo \"Settings\" and delete the repo on the top right button of the next screen.\r\n\r\nIf you need the deletion to be done in bulk, you can programmatically do it using the {{DELETE}} method using {{curl}}, for example, calling this [REST API in Stash|https://developer.atlassian.com/static/rest/stash/3.8.0/stash-rest.html#idp1379536].",

This is a dangerous situation: they should remove any previously deployed services as rebooting their server with such scripts deployed might cause damage to their Stash home\r\n* Give the customer an option to install the service with our standard service scripts. That way, customers will be able to start a newly deployed service and that will be supported for their instance's lifetime.\r\n\r\nThis is important because [this document|https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/running-bitbucket-server-as-a-linux-service-776640157.html] is not the same as what the current service script deployed by the Linux installer does.\r\n\r\n|*Customer Story:*\r\n  As of Stash 3.8 an upgrade workflow was introduced in the Stash installer. When using the installer and following the upgrade workflow, the installer is unable to detect and therefore update custom previously deployed Stash services on both Windows and Linux environments. \r\n  If a customer has a service set up previously done by our installer, the upgrade path will work and update the binaries it needs to start/stop the newly upgraded instance. Therefore, when the upgrade workflow is finished, starting/stopping Stash using the \"old\" (or custom services/scripts) will work normally for the operations team. \r\n  If the installer doesn't detect the expected service installations, however, it should warn the customers that previously installed/custom service installations will still be referring to their old binaries as we don't update them. From here we should warn them: \r\n- This is a dangerous situation: they should remove any previously deployed services as rebooting their server with such scripts deployed might cause damage to their Stash home or update their service scripts accordingly \r\n- Offer the service set up our standard service scripts. That way, customers will be able to start a newly deployed service and that will be supported for their instance's lifetime.|\r\n\r\n",
