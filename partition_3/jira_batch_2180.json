In our specific use-case, the default of descending date sort is great, but we also have some use cases where ascending would be preferred. \n\nThe first comment on CONF-8151 (https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-8151?focusedCommentId=77139&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-77139) makes it seem that ordering can be specified, however when using the example in that comment and replacing \"desc\" with \"asc\" or \"ascend\" or \"ascending\" the sort order is still descending by date.\n\nImplementation of this feature could simply be to allow the behavior suggested in that comment:\n{attachments:sortBy=date/asc} \n\nOr perhaps:\n{attachments:sortBy=date|order=asc} \n\nI would also suggest that the macro allow for users to specify order as any of: \"asc\" \"ascend\" \"ascending\" \"desc\" \"descend\" \"descending\" -- but with the markup editor going away in 4.0, I don't know whether this would be necessary or appropriate.",

This results in the fetching of all fields of the issue *and* all of the comments even though the vast majority of this information will be thrown away by Confluence when the macro is rendered.  This is extremely inefficient and results in very long page loading times when more than a handful of issues are displayed or if some fields have large quantities of information.\n\nThe workaround is to specify \"field=\" parameters for only the necessary fields that the macro will display as defined by the \"columns\" parameter of the macro.  Unfortunately this is not straightforward because the \"columns\" parameter of the macro uses actual column names but the \"field=\" parameters to the xml search URL uses database column names.  Also, the use must manually add \"field=link\" in order for the issue to be clickable.\n\nAll of this should be automatic and the fields fetched from JIRA by Confluence should be limited to only the fields specified via the \"columns\" parameter of the jiraissues macro.",

But it makes sense to extend the request to include links to all menu options from the Add, Tools, Browse, and user menus.\n\nThe reason for the request is that it is often difficult to train users (my org. has thousands) to use the Menu options, and we have standard pages that often require the same function to be\nperformed by many different users, e.g. printing a project brief document in Word. It would be great to simply put a link on the page that users can click to perform the desired function (see attached screenshot of a mockup).\n\nI realise this is quite a big ask and maybe it's not something that's high on the product roadmap but I'd like to report it anyway. I also realise that the [link-to macro|https://www.adaptavist.com/display/AtlassianConfluence/link-to+macro] by Adaptavist provides linkability to some of the menu options already, but it's only a few.\n\nThanks in advance for considering this request :)",

The reindex is multithreaded to make it faster, however this sometimes leads to problems of starving requests of CPU and RAM.  See CONF-19674 and [http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CONFKB/Confluence+Rebuild+Indexing+task+fails+to+complete].\n\nThe default is currently 1.5 * the number of cores available, which seems like it is still too many on a busy instance, so I think it should default to a lower number.\n\nMore importantly, while Confluence could try to make better guesses about how many threads should be used for a given index, it's very likely that the best guess will be made by the System Administrator triggering the re-index.  In particular they will have a good idea of whether they're running the re-index at a time when minimal external load is expected and they want it to be as fast as possible, or whether they're running it during serious load and they don't care how long it takes.\n\nOne option is to give them a choice between \"fast\" and \"low-impact\", but I suspect that abstraction will be unhelpful and unnecessary for the target-user.",

Thus, when Some User comments on a thread, I get gmail telling me I have a new notification from Adifferent User - because he happened to be the author of the first notification email I got about that particular page.\n\nA better way to do this would be to create an individual email address for each confluence user, using plus-addressing to make sure they all go back to the same place. For instance, notifications from Some User could be from \"Some User <extranet+suser@atlassian.com>\".\n\nAny email replies would end up at the same place as if the address was just \"extranet@atlassian.com\", but Gmail (and other MUAs) would be able to correctly disambiguate which person sent which email.",

This is \"nice to have\" functionality that was not in the original scope, and was added as it was a quickwin.\n\nThis had the main drawback for having to read the initial contents of the attachment for each page render. It's been removed for the moment, and users will need to manually enter the width and height.\n\nA few alternatives to prevent this overhead include:\n\n* Get the dimensions when selecting the attachment in the browser (complicates the UI code)\n* Add meta-data to attachments:\n   ** Store in lucene (no db changes, or migration tasks). Downside is delay in this information being available until the next index (up to 1 minute). This is probably a small issue as adding attachments to the current page under edit is not obvious (but can be done).\n   ** Store as addition data in the database against an attachment (e.g. key/value pairs). May slow down upload, as extraction of metadata will occur at upload. Metadata will be immediately available.\n   ** Other benefits include potential to extract other meta-data which may be searchable (e.g. mp3 tags, word document keywords, etc).\n\nThe preferred option is to add meta-data to attachments. The particular method for storing this is to be determined.\n\nDaniel is already planning on adding metadata information for attachments as part of a 20% project.

Or if no Flashplayer is installed the \"View PDF\" macro does not work.\nA compiled list of all requirements for all Atlassian plugins would be great.\n\nThanks,\nRuchi",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-22549].\n  {panel}\n\nWhen embedding using the multimedia macro (for example, a .mov), with no height/width explicitly specified, the Confluence page will display a fixed-size viewport regardless of the actual dimensions of the media.\n\nExample wiki markup:\n{noformat}\n{multimedia:name=example.mov}\n{noformat}\n\nMoreover, if the media dimensions are larger than the viewport, the macro will not scale the embedded media down to fit the view. This causes a few problems, because not only does the media get cut off, the playback bar can also be cut out, leaving it difficult/impossible for the user to control playback. (Tested this with a 640x480 sample .mov file from http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1425)\n\nThe [documentation|http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Embedding+Multimedia+Content] states that \"If not specified, the browser will determine the width/height based on the file type\", but doesn't seem clear what this actually means. If this means that, regardless of actual file dimensions, Confluence will display certain formats in certain fixed-sizes, we should clarify this in the documentation.\n\nRight now the user has to explicitly declare height/width parameters larger than the dimensions of the media, but this does not seem ideal. Possible solutions are to either pick up the dimensions and automatically resize the viewport accordingly, or to scale the media to fit in the fixed-sized viewport. If the latter is intended, then this ticket would be a duplicate of https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-22240",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-22542].\n  {panel}\n\nConfluence currently does not allow for an upgrade process that fits with our requirements of an enterprise system that is business critical.\n\nWe can't run the upgrade process on the live systemfor a number of reasons.\n\nAs a result in our enterprise environments it is best practice to preform updates in a development environment. Preform Testing regime, work out the bugs. When statisfied that the system can be upgraded, the production environment is then frozen or taken off-line and the upgrade is repreformed on the production environment with \"current\" content.\n\nOur process is currently/The method that now seems preferable is to us is:\n\n \n\n1.       Place a freeze on any new plugins (should be frozen anyway).\n\n2.       Create a new server with a fresh install of the *current* version of confluence. This creates a clean environment.\n\n3.       Copy to that the database and data directory from the production machine.\n\n4.       Test it to ensure the copying occurred correctly.  \n\n5.       Perform the in place upgrade, apply patches and upgrade plugins. \n\n6.       Perform thorough user testing. \n\n7.       Make notes of any modifications and fixes required.\n\n8.       Trash the test system (maybe overkill).\n\n9.       Place a content freeze on the current Confluence.\n\n10.   Repeat steps 2 .. 5\n\n11.   Apply noted modifications and fixes.\n\n12.   Test the modifications and any new content\n\n13.   Switch to the new server\n\n14.   Release the content freeze\n\n\nAs a rough estimate, this process inclusive of user testing will take at least 6 weeks. and has a relativily long period of the system either being offline or content frozen for 2-3day. Which is almost impossible given the current use by business units.\n\n---------------------------------------------\nWe need a system that enable the downtime to be minimal...and doesn't involve updating a live system...exposing it to undue risk, as it is a critical system.\n\nOriginally we were planning to create a completely fresh install of the latest version of confluence on a new VM then importing the data via the backup/restore function built into Confluence. \n\nThe purpose of this strategy was to ensure we always had the latest software in a 'clean' environment. Any cruft such as cached content, old plugins and other leftover files are not brought into the new environment and all the servers software is at the latest secure iteration.\n\nLastly it implies minimum content freeze time and downtime. This is because once the new environment is up and tested all that is required to make it live is to make a new backup of the current install and then import it into the new instance. Add to that some minor testing to ensure the import occurred correctly and we can enable the new server. \n\nthere was a concern that exporting the data from the old version of confluence may fail. Apparently if there are too many attachments the system can hang. According to one bug report if data and attachments exceed 1.9GB it will fail. Although it's the exporting that fails, our actual concern is that the import may fail silently. If we lost a swathe of attachments we may not know for months if at all. \n\nAs a result this method is not advisable! The problem of exporting has not been resolved and as the issue is now almost 3 years old. It is also listed as \"not advisable\" in the 3.5 upgrade notes.\n----------------------------------------\nThe recommended way to upgrade is to do an \"in place\" upgrade using a clone of the existing site, upgrading, testing and releasing to production. \"In place\" refers to the fact you are overwriting the existing files and then allowing the application to perform the upgrade steps when first started.  \n\nThis method negates the advantages I spoke of earlier. Particularly with respect to a clean server environment. \n\nAs a result we'd request that Atlassian give consideration to improving the 1)process for updating the application to align with best practice for critical enterprise systems and minimise downtown 2) improve documentation around upgrade including testing procedures.\n\n\n\n\n",

This would permit, for example:\n\n* adding a user to a directory when a user with the same username already exists in a different directory\n* management of shadowed users, those where a user with the same username exists in a different directory\n* remove membership on one directory but not on another.\n\nThis is how the Crowd UI works actually. It provides an amalgamated view from a particular application, but management is done on a per-directory level. This makes user administration much more logical in complicated situations.\n\n*Development notes*\n\nTo implement this, you can use the DirectoryService which is provided by Crowd and used by Crowd internally. There shouldn't be a need to implement a new API, rather \"just\" the addition of a dozen or so screens.\n",

Additionally, unaffiliated users were using the internal confluence directory and internal authentication to log in.  Moving to 3.5.2, we dropped the osuser config because it had gone from deprecated to functionally absent.

While the 'LDAP for User Management' option allows the Administrator to change the ldap.user.objectclass value to match the Directory's configuration, the Authen-only LDAP options do not, meaning it cannot be used in its current state with non-standard directories.\n\nCSP-61137 touches on this in passing.",

(Maybe the name is unknown, e.g. when creating templates).\n\nE.g. let's say I want to display a gallery with all files beginning with \"idea*\" (e.g. idea1.png, idea2.png, etc) at the top of my page, while at the same time have a gallery at the bottom with files named \"result*.png\". Note that I might also have other files that I do not want to display, e.g. \"balance.png, zero-selection.png and results-details.jpg\".\n\nIt would also be very useful if it was possible to filter by comment (as well as filename - both at the same time), e.g. displaying all images with the word \"good\" or \"NMR\" in the comment.",

When I search for something I really only want to search certain spaces.  I get a lot of results from spaces that I know don't contain the desired information.  It would be nice if I could exclude these spaces from my searches by default.  If for any reason I ever want to search them, I would need to take an extra step.\n\nTo clarify, our wiki is used by developers, project managers and clients.  Some of the spaces are geared towards clients which I rarely need to search.  However the same terms appear in the client spaces and the internal spaces, so I get a lot of 'noise' from the client spaces when I run a search.  There are rare times when I need to use those spaces, so it's not as simple as removing my permission to see those spaces.\n\nI'm envisioning something similar to google's search.  When I search for 'java' on google, it knows that I mean the programming language instead of coffee or a place in Indonesia.  This feature doesn't have to be intelligent enough to configure it's self based on my usage.  Even it if is a special page that I configure to only search spaces A, B and C.\n\nConfluence it a great product, but imo the search functionality is a weak point.  ",

We were using the swisscom nested group adapter successfully before and had set the filter (atlassian-user.xml) to groups with name \"PREFIX_OF_WIKI_GROUPS*\" and search started from AD root (nested groups can be in many places). Now when we upgraded to Crowd and removed the old nested group library (swisscom), nested groups no longer worked.\n\nAfter fighting the issue for a while we finally figured that nested group search is also affected with the filter (unlike in swisscom).\n\nWe would like to have only groups starting with PREFIX_OF_WIKI_GROUPS groups listed in group search but we would like the nested search to retrieve nested groups without restrictions. In effect this would give all PREFIX_OF_WIKI_GROUPS* groups' members (even from nested group named NOTAWIKIGROUP) and list only groups starting with PREFIX_OF_WIKI_GROUPS in group browser.\n\nIn short. I'm looking for a configuration option for embedded Crowd: \"Apply group filter when searching nested groups\" it seems to be on now and I would like to set it off.\n\nWe have now 3000+ unwanted groups listed in Confluence after the upgrade.",
