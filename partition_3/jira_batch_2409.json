      "description": "Hello World,\n\nSo my team has been developing a API and portal concurrently, and we\u2019ve been using pipelines to build and deploy our Docker images to AWS ECS. There is an issue where sometimes there is an API change and we want to build it and prepare it for deployment but wait until the portal dev is ready, to prevent breaking changes since the admin portal isn\u2019t up yet and the rest of us need to be able to access it. We fixed this issue by adding a manual step, so the portal dev can simply go into bitbucket, and hit the manual step after he\u2019s ready. But we\u2019ve found the Slack integration to be slightly lackluster.\n\nWhen a manual step finishes, it appears as a full pipeline in Slack, so if you have two steps with a manual button between them, you get a message for when the pipeline starts, than you get a pipeline completed success or fail for the first step, than a success or fail for the second. This makes just peeking at a slack message on my phone kinda ineffective, because I don\u2019t know if that success was the first step, or the second step. It would be nice to get a slack message that says a step has completed, than when the full pipeline is done, you get the normal success or failure message. To add to this, the reason for making this post, it would also be nice to be able to hit a button on the message between manual steps to approve and start the next step, similarly to re-running a failed pipeline now. This allows us to do a full deployment, without having to go into bitbucket, go to the repo, then deployments, than the deployment, than hitting the button. We could just go into slack and hit next.\n\n\u200c\n\nThanks for consideration,\n\nSamuel [~1f4e676b31f6]",

It would be best if Bitbucket pipelines stayed in lock step with this. Alternatively, allow us to define the version of Docker we would like to use.\n\nAt a minimum, patch versions should be available ASAP for security and bug fixes. However major versions typically have much desired new features. Also, Docker has gotten much better at maintaining backwards compatibility with deprecation notices.\n\nPlease upgrade Docker to the current version for Bitbucket pipelines.",
