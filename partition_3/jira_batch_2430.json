      "description": "I just tried to download my repositories code from the tag tab, because I wanted the code for a specific tagged version. I selected the gzipped version, and was a bit surprised when I saw the downloaded files name.\n\nThe naming convention for these files seem to be {{[team]-[repository]-[commit-hash].[file-extension]}}.\\\\\nI can live with this, but I honestly expected the tag to be included. Especially because the URL for the download has the form {{https://bitbucket.org/dataproces/text-search-service/get/[tag].tar.gz}}, and the tag is the information that is important to me in this case. After all, I did initiate the download from the tag tab.\n\nThis led me to think about how I would optimally have the files named, such that they are readable, and include the information that is important.\n\nFirst of all, I suggest that the character between the parts is changed to an underscore ({{_}}), instead of a hyphen ({{-}}) because the hyphen is used between words in repository name slugs. This gives us the following form: {{[team]_[repository]_[commit-hash].[file-extension]}}\n\nSecondly, I would like the tag to be included. I suggest the following form for this: {{[team]_[repository]_tag-[tag]_[commit-hash].[file-extension]}}.\\\\\nThe observant reader will notice the {{tag_}} that prepends the tag. This, I hope, is obvious from reading the next paragraph.\n\nThirdly, downloads from the branch tab should probably have something similar to tags done to it, and in accordance with the above, this gives us the following form:  {{[team]_[repository]_branch-[branch]_[commit-hash].[file-extension]}}\n\nLastly, one could argue that including the current date(+time?) in a branch file name would be beneficial as well.\n\nThat was it from me (for now). Please add your thoughts below, if you have a contribution to this discussion I am hoping to start with this proposal.",

This works well for e.g text based viewers, but for graphical viewers, especially those utilizing zooming, sizing to take up all available space makes a lot more sense.\n\nIt would be very useful to have the module tell Bitbucket whether the iFrame should fit the content or fill the remaining space.\n\nE.g I am working on a file viewer for PCB CAD files. These CAD files are typically big (mostly landscape A4 format) and thus the fileviewer allows to pan and zoom these files and the viewbox takes all available space. However, since Bitbucket sets the height of the iframe for the viewer to fit it&#x27;s contents, the iframe is only as big as the fixed-height menu items, making the fileviewer pretty much useless:\n\n!671080524-Screen%20Shot%202018-09-03%20at%2000.46.15.png|thumbnail!\n\nThe only way to currently fix this is to set a fixed height to the viewbox, either resulting in unused space or extra scrollbars negatively impacting usability, or coming up with a complicated workaround to detect the maximum height impacting performance.",
