Issue Summary\r\n\r\nThe Pull requests page of the repo shows a spinner, when:\r\n * The user is logged out of bitbucket.org\r\n * The user is logged in but they don't have access to the repo in question\r\n * The repo in question does not exist\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nThis has been reproduced with the latest version of Chrome, Firefox and Safari.\r\n\r\nFirst scenario\r\n1. Make sure you are logged out of bitbucket.org\r\n2. Open the PR page of one of your repos ([https://bitbucket.org/repo-owner/repo-slug/pull-requests/])\r\n\r\nSecond scenario\r\n1. Make sure you are logged out of bitbucket.org\r\n2. Open the PR page of a repo that doesn't exist ([https://bitbucket.org/repo-owner/repo-slug/pull-requests/])\r\n\r\nThird scenario\r\n1.

While you are logged in bitbucket.org, try to open the PR page of a repo that you don't have access to\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nIn the first scenario, the expected result would be a redirect to id.atlassian.com so that the user logs in.\r\n\r\nIn the second scenario, the expected result would be a page informing the user that \"The link has no power here\".\r\n\r\nIn the third scenario, the expected result would be a page informing the user that \"The link has no power here\"\r\n\r\nIn the fourth scenario, the expected result would be a page informing the user they don't have access to the repo.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nIn all 4 scenarios, the actual result is a page with a spinner:\r\n !Screen Shot 2019-11-11 at 15.33.25.png|thumbnail! \r\n \r\nh3.

Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create a new repo\r\n # Create, commit, and push a file\r\n # Create, commit, and push a file again\r\n # Create a tag and push the tag (e.g. tag_123)\r\n # Create a new branch in BB UI with the name \"tag_123\"\r\n # Once done, clone the repo with the specific branch \"tag_123\" in a new folder using: {{git clone <REPO_URL> --branch=tag_123}}\r\n # Create a file and commit\r\n # When we push, only use {{git push}} command\r\n\r\n*Test Repo*: [https://bitbucket.org/srstaging/tags-testing]\r\n\r\nNow, check the filters below:\r\n * Tag Commits: [https://bitbucket.org/srstaging/tags-testing/commits/tag/tag_123]\r\n * Branch Commits: [https://bitbucket.org/srstaging/tags-testing/commits/branch/tag_123]\r\n\r\nWe can see that the result is the same, but it shouldn't be.\r\n\r\nAlso, if we run the below API calls below, it shows only the same result, but again it shouldn't be.\r\n{code:java}\r\ncurl -u username:password https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/srstaging/tags-testing/src/master/?fields=values.path\r\n\r\ncurl -u username:password https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/srstaging/tags-testing/src/tag_123/?fields=values.path\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n====\r\n{\"values\":[{\"path\":\"file_1.txt\"},{\"path\":\"file_2.txt\"}]}\r\n{code}\r\nCompare the API results in BB UI (See below links):\r\n * [https://bitbucket.org/srstaging/tags-testing/src/master/] - 2 Files\r\n * [https://bitbucket.org/srstaging/tags-testing/src/tag_123/] - 3 Files\r\n\r\nh3.

Workaround\r\n\r\nAs a workaround, we need to avoid identical branch and tag name as this will break the UI.\r\n We can also rename the existing tag by following the Git commands below:\r\n # Clone your repo\r\n # Delete the tag: {{git tag -d tag_123}}\r\n # Push the deleted tag: {{git push origin :refs/tags/tag_123}}\r\n # Checkout to the commit hash (where the identical name is): {{git checkout 6a7ee1f}}\r\n # Choose a new tag name: {{git tag new_tag}}\r\n # Push the new tag name: {{git push origin : new_tag}}",

      "description": "I have a suggestion regarding the Merge Checks under Bitbucket Cloud. I will break this down into a few points below to paint the whole picture.\r\n\r\nThe crux of this suggestion is around a confusion that can happen here;\r\n !image-2019-11-01-14-13-43-021.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nI took a screenshot here so that I can explain the visual detailing behind this. I have come across situations where bitbucket users (myself included) *assumed* that merge checks would stop merges from happening based on the conditions set. Since I have tested this myself, I can understand the current perspective, but when as a person new to Bitbucket looks at this page, the first impression *seems* to be that the *checks* are *blocks*. The \"preventing merge\" is a standout premium feature and it is an amazing piece of work.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, I think we can try to change how the UI looks slightly to provide a better understanding for new Bitbucket users, purely because a wrong merge can be catastrophic. \r\n I worked on a case recently, the users belonged to a startup and had set up the Bitbucket branch permission assuming that merge checks would block a merge from happening. \r\n When a situation arose, they were surprised (and disappointed) that the merge went through without any of the checks stopping it.\r\n\r\nThis is the response from the same customer;\r\n{panel}\r\n*It would be great if you completely remove those settings since they serve\r\n no purpose on the free plan and are actually very dangerous. *\r\n We were under the False impression that a production branch was protected\r\n when it indeed was not.\r\n\r\nI understand the value of the paid membership, but our startup is not at\r\n that point where we are generating any income yet.\r\n Hence very important that we do not lose any faith from any clients as they\r\n are carrying us month to month.\r\n{panel}\r\n*I do empathise with the second paragraph here*, I think as a company we all know how much we value our customers. I think this is a situation where we can take some action and slightly tweak the UI. \r\n I do have a suggestion here as well; A link explaining how merge 'checks' work, one that *clarifies that merges will not be blocked on Free and Standard Plan, only checked.*\u00a0\r\n\r\n !image-2019-11-01-14-13-55-119.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nI have complete faith that a user can use the link and better understand the situation and design their SOP accordingly. This would help prevent such mishaps in the future.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\n\r\nRegards\r\n Manu Abraham",
