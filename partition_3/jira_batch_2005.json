Issue Summary\r\n\r\nWhen editing a certain type of macro, users can overwrite the macro itself by mistake, especially if using an [IME|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_method]. The problem can be severe, where users spend a lot of time to make changes in the macro modal such as for the Roadmap Planner.\r\nh3. Environment\r\n\r\nVerified with these macros:\r\n * Roadmap Planner: [https://youtu.be/cVvTHMR5G0k]\r\n * Table of Content: [https://youtu.be/FE1qFeyoHkc]\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nSuppose you use a Roadmap Planner. It can happen to a similar type of other macros such as the Table of Contents macro.\r\n # Create a page with the old editor (cf. [the new editor|https://confluence.atlassian.com/confcloud/confluence-editing-improvements-945107733.html])\r\n # Insert a roadmap planner macro once\r\n # Edit the inserted roadmap planner\r\n**  !Screenshot 2019-06-07 13.31.01.png|thumbnail! \r\n # Focus back to on the editor (this can happen accidentally such as in case you use [Google Japanese IME|https://www.google.co.jp/ime/]; but you can type tab-key several times to intentionally reproduce the behavior)\r\n # Type something\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nRemove the focus to the macro before launching the macro's modal so that users won't mistakenly edit the page.\r\n This is the behavior other macros do such as Iframe macro and Info macro, which can reduce a chance to lose the content by accident.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nSince the macro is focused on the editor, the macro can be removed by mistake.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nConsider adding yourself as a watcher to be kept informed as to the state of the bug moving forward. With that way, if our development team updates the ticket, you'll be notified via email. Until then,\r\n\r\n\r\n* Create a page with the new editor.\r\n**  !Screenshot 2019-06-07 15.24.28.png|thumbnail! \r\n",

Background\r\nSee conversation below:\r\n\r\nTo give more context, this feature request is also related to our app Scroll Documents as mentioned in the other tickets.\r\n\r\nPlease find the requested information below:\r\n * Use cases, scenarios, and benefits:\r\nThe copy page tree operation is the fundamental operation and one of the core features of our app. As a means to make it more powerful and provide users with more flexibility, we would need these additional options. By flexibility, we mean that in many of our operations we use the copy page tree operation to have multiple copies of pages, and page trees in the same space. Many of the times, prefixes can get long and when looking for the pages in the page tree, it can become quite cumbersome.\r\n\r\n* Which particular REST endpoint were you referring to?\r\n{code}\r\nPOST /wiki/rest/api/content/<id>/pagehierarchy/copy\r\n{code}\r\n*  \"Add suffix\" - add suffix to what and how does this help you?\r\n From our user studies/tests, we found that many users preferred to use postfix when copying a page hierarchy. This option also improves the readability of the Confluence Page Tree.\r\n",

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nIn Confluence, if the user restricts a page for groups with an uppercase letter, members of the group will not be able to find the page on the sidebar, or, search for the same while using the quick search feature.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce:\r\n # As a *site-admin* of the application, make sure to create a new group that will be using uppercase letters through [https://site.atlassian.net/admin]. For example, \"testiNG\".\r\n # With the created group (and also, the *Application Access* granted for the same, if needed), make sure to add specific users to the same.\r\n # Now, in Confluence, access a child page from the Home page of a space and *restrict* the same for the created group.\r\n # Ask one of the group members to access the page by sending the link\r\n # Ask them to check the sidebar and also, try to search for it.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe page should be searchable and displayed in the correct hierarchy on the sidebar.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nOnly the Home page link is displayed on the sidebar and the page is not findable. If expanding the home link, the page will not be listed.\r\nh4.

We currently have link to headings that are natively supported in the new editor without the need for the old Anchor Macro. You can directly reference headers by copying the link upon hover or by adding #Header-Name to the URL of your page. With our originally announced plan to clean up macros (https://confluence.atlassian.com/confcloud/we-re-cleaning-up-our-macros-946028471.html) and our implementation of link to headings, we currently have no plans in the near term to bring back the Anchor Macro in its original state. \r\n\r\nYou can track our upcoming roadmap here: https://confluence.atlassian.com/confcloud/confluence-cloud-editor-roadmap-967314556.html. If we have any updated plans, we will update the thread here.

Problem Definition\r\n\r\nThe new macro called\u00a0*Panel*\u00a0in the new editor allows users to contextually switch between:\r\n * Info -\u00a0{color:#0000ff}Blue{color}\r\n * Note -\u00a0{color:#800080}Purple{color}\r\n * Success -\u00a0{color:#008000}Green{color}\r\n * Warning -\u00a0{color:#ffa500}Orange{color}\r\n * Error -\u00a0{color:#ff0000}Red{color}\r\n\r\n!Screenshot 2019-08-22 at 11.50.14.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nThere's no option for the user to choose on their own which of the icons or colors show, or if they want an icon to show at all.\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nCustomers should be able to edit/change/set the background color for panel macro and choose if they want to display an icon.\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\n\r\nThe customer wants to customize the panel macro, which they are not able to do because of the new editor changes.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nNo current workaround, but I've used the new Layout feature mentioned in\u00a0[Confluence Editing Improvements|https://confluence.atlassian.com/confcloud/confluence-editing-improvements-945107733.html]\u00a0to display as a panel of my own.",
