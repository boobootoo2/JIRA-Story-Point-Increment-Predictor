This way, I can do something like declare the project name, docker image name, and so on within the file rather than having to do so through the bitbucket UI which makes it a bit easier to set up new builds along with new projects. This is particularly useful when working in a microservice architecture and services are being stood up somewhat rapidly and even changing just as rapidly.\n\nHere&#x27;s a sample pipeline config for one of my projects. Notice in the artifacts area, I have to hardcode the path because I don&#x27;t have an environment variable set, and I don&#x27;t really have an opportunity to run the export command to set it like I do for the script areas.

Original ticket: BBS-35401]\n\nDear Atlassian,\n\nBitbucket SSH server drop the connection in some cases when an unsupported RSA public key is offered for authentication.\n\nI normally use a hardware token with a 1024bit rsa key. This key size is not supported by bitbucket since 2016, so I generate a software token for bitbucket access.\n\nUnfortunately when my hardware key precedes the software key at the authentication then bitbucket disconnects and doesn&#x27;t wait for the software key to offered.\n\nh1.

For my use cases it is irrelevant but OK)\n* After saved, UI displays it will run every Thursday at 01:AM (I have no idea about what timezone is being used here but it is deftly none of the above two)\n\nThanks",

      "description": "Since Bitbucket is limited to 2 GB repositories, it is important to manage the repository&#x27;s file size. Binaries (especially large ones) should be excluded. Package managers should be used.\n\nBut mistakes happen. Binaries get checked in by accident. Old projects have dependencies checked in from before a language&#x27;s package manager became popular, and they can&#x27;t be easily removed without breaking the project on those commits. Dependencies aren&#x27;t available via package manager, or a custom build with source code modification was checked in and there isn&#x27;t time/budget to fix that right now.\n\nBitBucket&#x27;s interface makes dealing with these situations difficult. The garbage collection happens completely transparently; I can&#x27;t even tell when it last completed. I have no idea what options it ran with. I don&#x27;t even know which commands were invoked. Even once you&#x27;ve corrected a mistake and deleted some binary from the repository (including historical commits), it can still linger in the internal storage files for some time, maybe forever if the right clean up commands are never invoked.\n\ngit provides a number of useful commands for cleaning up garbage from the repository:\n\n* {{git gc}}\n* {{git gc --aggressive}}\n* {{git repack}}  (with arguments)\n* {{git prune}}\n\nSome of them are discussed in more detail [here|https://stackoverflow.com/q/28720151/].\n\nBitBucket provides no useful interface for invoking these or understanding what has been invoked on the repository. BitBucket does not need to provide direct access to the repository on the server, of course, but the available tooling needs some serious improvement.\n\n# Be more transparent. The admin interface should tell me when a garbage collection was last completed and should tell me what command it was. It should tell me when the next one is scheduled to run under normal circumstances. It doesn&#x27;t have to name the full command, but some kind of indication would be helpful.\n# Ideally, I could tell the system to invoke one immediately when I think it&#x27;s needed. Having limitations on this to prevent abuse would be fine.\n# There should be some kind of option(s) to cause the system to invoke more aggressive clean up efforts, like {{git gc --aggressive}} or maybe some form of {{git repack}}. These would be _especially_ useful for mistakes that happened recently and can be cleaned up by modifying recent history. Even if I can&#x27;t invoke one manually, I could tell the system to be more aggressive on the next attempt.",

This is a pretty awful user experience, since there may be several comments generated in one discussion. If they make a new comment while you are typing, you&#x27;ll miss out on new, possibly relevant information until you manually reload the page!\n\nReal-time updates would also be much appreciated on the \"view all PRs\" page. For instance, if one of my pull requests was merged, I&#x27;ll have to refresh the page page to see that that it got merged.\n\nOf course, this is not an issue if you&#x27;re coming to the page for a brief, one-time visit, but I often have the PR page open in the browser as I work, since we try to move quickly on those. It&#x27;s tough to use it like a modern web app without real-time updates.",
