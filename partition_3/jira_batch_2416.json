Why isn\u2019t that mentioned on the profile page? Why don\u2019t any of my branches show up on the profile\u2019s repositories page?

It only displays 22 lines at a time on most computer screens.\n* The sidebar on the right takes up too much space, and can&#x27;t be removed. It&#x27;s hard to collapse it as well.\n* The scrolling doesn&#x27;t work smoothly when also scrolling the web page.\n* On the mobile browser, tapping it always makes the keyboard popup, even though the text is not editable.\n* The syntax highlighting in the code doesn&#x27;t use clear colors.\n\nNone of these problems happened on the previous code viewer, it would be great if we can still revert back to the old UI.",

It now looks like this \"Find a user by their name\" (seems you may have also added an &#x27;assign to me&#x27; option to quickly assign a task to myself which is fine, but the problem is the missing auto list).  I am not sure if it&#x27;s a bug that the list does not default display all members or you guys intentionally made it so I need to start typing a username before the team member will even be suggested (which makes no sense to me at all .. I have to memorise all of my team members usernames?).\n\n!2592945107-issue1.png|thumbnail!\n\nAfter using your service for many years and creating thousands of tasks I find this update to be extremely frustrating - before it used to take me 1-2 seconds just to click that Assign to menu and then directly click again to select who I wanted to assign the task to.  Now I need to click on the field and MANUALLY start typing a name because I can see any of my developers!  The list is actually empty until I start typing the developer&#x27;s name!  So not only does it take me much longer now because I have to manually start typing just to see the list, I also need to memorise all of my developers usernames otherwise I cannot find them to assign the task to!!  Please fix this so we can actually see the list of team members again as default!  If you want to have the type and find team members, that&#x27;s fine, but you need to provide a list of team members as deafult before a user starts typing as well!\n\n!2152949633-issue2.png|thumbnail!",

Our solution for the past 8 months or so has been to wrap our Docker image pull API calls with logic to retry failed image pulls. This makes our build pipeline more stable, but of course can cause some pipelines to run for a long time when there are a large number of errors. [Pipeline 8141|https://bitbucket.org/contrastsecurity/java-agent/addon/pipelines/home#%21/results/8141] is an example of a Pipeline with a significant number of errors (which can be seen in the console output). The errors caused the test to run for 100 minutes (usually completes in 60 minutes). We consider this a partial outage of Bitbucket Pipelines. Because we are using 2x instances, this is a costly failed run for us (200 build minutes). It is also costly to our dev team to wait 100 minutes to find out a build failed due to significant errors from the Bitbucket Pipelines Docker service",

      "description": "In the 1.0 version of the comment API you are able to specify the commit sha or revision to \"anchor\" a comment to when posting inline comments using the \"dest_rev\", \"base_rev\", and \"anchor\" keys. This is still not possible in version 2.0 of the API as far as the documentation says and we have tested, which makes the API impossible to use for a robust integration. This seems like a major loss of functionality that will render our application very unreliable and in some cases unusable to customers when 1.0 API support is removed. All other code providers we have integrated with support this functionality (github, gitlab, bitbucket server, bitbucket cloud 1.0 APIs etc).\n\nWithout knowing which revision your comment will get posted to, the line number and path could be pointing to the wrong place since each revision/commit can change the underlying code. It seems like the current behavior is to just use the latest commit on a PR with this API, but given the async nature of bitbucket it is impossible for the caller to reliably and robustly know what will be the latest revision is on the pull request since it may have changed since you last checked it even if checking immediately before posting. However it also makes it so a client/consumer of the API can&#x27;t post comments if there has been a change since they started referencing a line on a file.\n\nSimilarly in the listing 2.0 API for pull request comments, we can&#x27;t get this revision any way except by parsing the {{href}} link which is somewhat unfortunate but it does at least work for now.",
