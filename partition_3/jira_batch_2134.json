This would make the table non-rectangular, as each row may have a different number of cells.  They preferred this vs. a rectangular table that had an abundance of empty cells at the end of each row.\nNow, the GUI editor wants to only insert whole rows or whole columns, and merging the cells in any way doesn't get me the look I'm trying for. Is there going to be a way to add a new cell to the end of an existing row, without creating a whole column?",

We edit the page and replace the existing metadata-list macro with the Page Properties macro.\n\nThis has resulted in extremely slow load speeds for the pages using the page properties report macro.\n\n|| Page  ||  Load speed ||\n| Page with \"Page Properties Report\" macro | ~38 seconds |\n| Page without \"Page Properties Report\" macro | ~1 second |\n\nFor the example above: There are 780 pages in the space.

We also would like to make it support external CAS for authentication that requires us to change all existing login usernames to another format.\n\nThe current usernames are in short names and we look to find a way to do bulk right-padding with a common string '@something.com' for all usernames.\n\nI hope I have expressed well our requirement. Looking forward to hearing from you.\n\nThanks,\nSam\n",

Reproduction steps:\n# Download and install [Confluence 5.5-OD-28-010|https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/download-od] or Confluence 5.6.1\n# Under Production Installation click Start Setup button\n# Paste in a Confluence evaluation license and hit next\n\nh3. Expected behavior\nUser would be presented with the Choose a Database Configuration screen, and be able to setup whatever DB they want.\n\nh3. Actual behavior\nConfluence setup immediately selects HSQLDB and the user is eventually presented with the Configure User Management screen, completely bypassing Choose a Database Configuration screen.\n\nh3. Workaround\n* Use a non-evaluation license (ex. commercial license, developer license, etc) while installing 5.6.1\n* If you are evaluating Confluence and must use an evaluation license, install Confluence 5.5.6 with an evaluation license (this will allow you to choose an external database), then upgrade to 5.6.1",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-34260].\n  {panel}\n\nMy company has been using JIRA, Agile, and Fisheye for several years now.  We are currently evaluating Confluence 5.5.2.  So far, it has received extremely favorable reviews from our development and management teams.  One glaring missing feature, which apparently was available in previous versions of Confluence, is the ability to receive the full content of created/updated page in email notifications.  Many of our team members work a good part of their time outside of our internal network and will not be able to simply click a link on an email and reach our Confluence installation.  We need to see the entire page content in the email itself.  It looks as though the previously existing feature has been requested to be returned over and over again, as in CONF-28503.  \n\nWell, here is another request to bring back this feature.  Or, can someone explain to me how I can enable this feature in Confluence 5.5.2?  My team wants the ability to simply click on the \"Share\" button and send an email to team members that includes the entire content of the page they are sharing, not just a link back to the page in Confluence.

Set A Cookie-\n-Simply login to Confluence using Internet Explorer and tick \"Remember my login on this computer\". So long as this cookie is maintained by Internet Explorer (i.e. until you wipe your cookies or click log out), you will be able to successfully view all images when viewing your document in Word. Note that this will be remain effective after you close IE although it will need to be performed after a restart of the server.-\n\n*Edit:* Set A Cookie work around does not work.

However, often knowledge spreads over external links which are embedded throughout a page. But since there is no control over external content, knowledge might become spotty if the external content happens to vanish.\n\nI'd like to propose an option where external links in a page are automatically detected and its contend archived within Confluence. Of course this would have to be restricted to some degree since mirroring entire sites is no fun for anyone. It does not have to be perfect. Even a shabby and badly formatted .pdf version of the external content (depth == 1) would suffice. Because if important content is missing, I'd rather have a badly formatted copy instead of nothing.",

However, one thing that always bugs me is that I need to use the mouse to bring up the macro editor for a selected macro.\n\nProposal:\nALT+SPACE Could bring up the list of actions for a given macro (normally Edit/Remove). Then I need to be able to move in this list using TAB/SHIFT+TAB. A Following ENTER would execute the action. This behavior would be especially useful for macros defining their own action (status, team calendar etc.)\n\nALT+ENTER would instantly do the default action. In almost all cases this is bringing up the macro editor.\n\nIn normal cases this behavior would be enabled when the macro is 'text'-selected. One option to think about would be to also extend this behavior to the macro directly following the text cursor. Would remove the need to first SHIFT+ARROW the macro.\n\nPlease have a heart for our keyboard loving users and make it happen. thx!",
