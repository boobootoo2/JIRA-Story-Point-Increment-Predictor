      "description": "As suggested in [issue 12051|BCLOUD-12051], I have been attempting to use the undocumented v2.0 API /refs endpoint to fetch tags and branches from a repo that has a lot of them.\n\nThe branch and tag data returned by this endpoint looks fine, however the pagination of the results is not working properly.  The \"pagelen\" field always appears to be returning a value of 10 regardless of the size of the \"values\" list (which itself seems to be correct), and also the \"next\" field is being returned even in cases where there is no additional branch/tag data remaining.\n\n(In this case, calling the \"next\" URL returns a result that (correctly) has an empty \"values\" but yet still includes the \"next\" field.  So I currently don&#x27;t have any way to programmatically determine when the end of the result set has been reached.)",

When a developer wants to merge its feature to master, it has to create a pull request. Each pull request is automatically built and tested by Jenkins which then approves commit (we use Bitbucket pull request builder plugin for Jenkins). After Jenkins approves the commit, the developer is free to merge the pull request into master.\n\nHowever, we are facing the following problem: two developers want to merge two features in the same time. They both create a pull request, and Jenkins builds, tests and approves both pull requests. Then they both (not knowing about each other), click merge and we get two merge commits in master.\\\\\nSince we do not like merge commits that are not direct result of fast forward merge because we want to have linear git history, we expect all our developers to have their feature branches rebased on master branch. However, when both developers merge their pull requests into master, one merge is expected fast-forward merge, and another is non-fast-forward merge (the second pull request actually gets updated, but our developers unfortunately do not pay attention to this, although we ask them to).\n\nWe would like to know how we can setup Bitbucket to automatically decline pull requests that are not fast forwards.",

      "description": "Hello - we have a private repository (http://bitbucket.org/dittolabs/ditto-cnn/) that got a 1GB warning recently. I used the BFG repo cleaner and pruned / cleaned / deleted a lot of the repo. On the bitbucket page, I still get the 1GB warning and the repo size claims to be 1.8GB. When I clone a fresh copy, it is still very tiny. Running git count-objects -v yields the following:\n\ncount: 0\\\\\nsize: 0\\\\\nin-pack: 7732\\\\\npacks: 1\\\\\nsize-pack: 1343\\\\\nprune-packable: 0\\\\\ngarbage: 0\\\\\nsize-garbage: 0\n\nIt would be nice to know that my pruning / filtering worked right, but it seems that the file size on Bitbucket never changes. Is it possible that Bitbucket needs to run git-gc on their servers to re-calculate the repo size? If so, what do I need to do to make this happen?",

The latter one however is not sufficient: this way they could only add people to the repos directly, not via user groups (which is generally a bad practice).\n\nMaybe BCLOUD-2323 will also solve this?",
