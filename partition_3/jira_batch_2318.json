Summary\r\n\r\nWhen JDK11 is installed and appropriately configured on a Windows server, the Bitbucket installer still extracts and configures itself to use the bundled JRE.\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\n\r\n * Any [compatible version|https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/supported-platforms-776640981.html] of Windows Server\r\n* AdoptOpenJDK11 or other Java 11 equivalent is installed\r\n* {{%JAVA_HOME%}} and {{%JRE_HOME%}} are both pointed to the Java 11 instance \r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Install [AdoptOpenJDK11|https://adoptopenjdk.net/releases.html?variant=openjdk11&jvmVariant=hotspot#x64_win] on a Windows Server instance\r\n# Set the system environment variables {{JAVA_HOME}} and {{JRE_HOME}} to point to the installed JDK from the previous step\r\n# Download and run the Bitbucket Windows installer, opting to install the Windows services automatically\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\n* The bundled JRE is not extracted into {{%BITBUCKET_INSTALL%}}\r\n* The Windows Services are configured to use the configured {{%JRE_HOME%\\bin\\server\\jvm.dll}}, which points to AdoptOpenJDK11\r\n* The {{JRE_HOME}} value in the {{set-jre-home.bat}} script is set to where AdoptOpenJDK11 was installed\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\n* The bundled JRE is extracted into the {{%BITBUCKET_INSTALL%}} directory\r\n* The Windows Service is configured to use the bundled JRE\r\n* The {{set-jre-home.bat}} script's {{JRE_HOME}} entry is set to use the bundled JRE\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\n* The issue does *not* occur when JDK8 is installed instead. Bitbucket doesn't include the bundled JRE, and the services/scripts are configured appropriately.\r\n\r\nh3.

While paging through the comments, it would highlight the unread comments in yellow, so you couldn't miss them.\r\n\r\nNow we have git and BitBucket, and it wasn't really viable to continue using Collaborator (Collaborator does have a Bitbucket integration, but I had no influence over the enterprise Bitbucket integration to make this a possibility).\r\n\r\nThe pull request view in Bitbucket has some niceties, but what I find with working with many developers in our organization is that many of them miss comments they need to see.\u00a0 As comments are tied to commits, they are often lost when viewing code in the \"Diff\" panel (as they will usually be using the \"all commits\" choice).\u00a0 The only place they would be able to see all comments is by scrolling down on the Overview page.\u00a0 We integrate the SonarQube plugin, which results in the start of the comments section to appear right at the bottom of the screen, leaving any real comments only visible by scrolling past the end of the first page.\r\n\r\nIf developers or authors forget to do this, they simply don't see the comments, and they approve or merge PRs without noticing the issues they need to discuss.\r\n\r\nWe also send email for each comment, but that depends on developers managing their email tool well enough to make this effective.\u00a0 Many of the devs in our organization seem to not do this well.\r\n\r\nI suggest you implement a feature set that does something like what Collaborator does, which would require storing a record for each participant/pr pair, and an entry for each comment, indicating whether that participant has seen that comment, and a visual indicator of such.",

In the transformered(tm) version under /bitbucket/home/plugins/.osgi-cache/transformed-plugins/, I find this, among other things, this: \r\n\r\ncom.atlassian.bitbucket.dmz.permission;version=\"[6.6.0,6.6.0]\"\r\n\r\nLooks good. Works fine. \r\n\r\nNow, when deploying on 6.6.1, then in MANIFEST.MF I similarly find a generated statement saying:\r\n\r\ncom.atlassian.bitbucket.dmz.permission;version=\"[6.6.1,6.6.1]\"\r\n\r\nHowever, this time the package fails to resolve causing the missing requirement message/stack trace above.\r\n\r\nLooking at the OSGi browser, the package version 6.6.1 is available and exported by the System bundle, so I don't know why it fails to resolve. It also has resolution optional, so could you advice on why this appears to be working on 6.6.0 and not 6.6.1? This is HIGHLY critical for us as customers on 6.6.1 are already affected and can no longer install the addon. We have yet to find a way around this. By extension, it also means we currently have no way forward on Bitbucket and I'm worried that whichever change triggered this will find its way into newer releases on the rest of the Atlassian portfolio sooner rather than later (I assume the transformer/UPM stuff is all mostly shared libraries).\r\n\r\nI've tried adding an OSGi instruction making the package optional and with a wider version range (though I didn't expect either to work - we don't even use this package directly but I assume it's pulled in transitively by us including bitbucket-api and bitbucket-spi). Now, the Import-Package statement actually gets changed to mandatory in the transformed JAR. The version also gets mangled somehow with an asterisk added to the end (not sure if this is significant or not). In any case the resolution fails. Example:\r\n\r\n<Import-Package>com.atlassian.bitbucket.dmz.permission;resolution:=\"optional\";version:=\"[5.0,6.6.2)\"*;resolution:=\"optional\"</Import-Package>\r\n\r\nThis yields a transformed MANIFEST.MF containing:\r\n\r\ncom.atlassian.bitbucket.dmz.permission;resolution:=\"mandatory\";version:=\"[5.0,6.6.2)*\"\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nAddon installs and finds package\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\norg.osgi.framework.BundleException missing requirement\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\nFrom vendor:\r\n{quote}\r\nIt may also be of interest to you that we had one customer reporting similar problems with some other plugins on 6.6.1 as well (I'm not familiar with any of them): \r\n\r\nCustomer says:\r\n\"Similar behavior is also occurring on MIBEX plugins:\r\n\r\nRepository Dashboard for Bitbucket Server\r\nRepository Templates for Bitbucket Server\r\nSonar for Bitbucket Server\"\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nFrom vendor:\r\n{quote}\r\nWe ended up hastily rewriting the plugin base to spring-scanner-1 over the weekend. This seems to have worked around the problem so this is no longer an issue for us.\r\n\r\nThe last reproducible version would be Kantega SSO 3.6.3, just in case you want to look into it (3.6.5 onwards is now transformerless). \r\n{quote}",

Remote attackers can exploit this argument injection vulnerability if they are able to access a Git repository in Bitbucket Server or Bitbucket Data Center. If public access is enabled for a project or repository, then attackers are able to exploit this issue anonymously.\r\n\r\n*Affected versions:*\r\n * All versions of Bitbucket Server & Bitbucket Data Center\u00a0before 5.16.10\u00a0(the fixed version for 5.16.x ), from 6.0.0 before 6.0.10 (the fixed version for 6.0.x), from 6.1.0 before 6.1.8 (the fixed version for 6.1.x), from 6.2.0 before 6.2.6 (the fixed version for 6.2.x), from 6.3.0 before 6.3.5 (the fixed version for 6.3.x), from 6.4.0 before 6.4.3 (the fixed version for 6.4.x), and from 6.5.0 before 6.5.2 (the fixed version for 6.5.x)\u00a0are affected by this vulnerability.\u00a0\r\n\r\nh3. *What You Need to Do*\r\n\r\nAtlassian recommends that you upgrade to the latest version. For a full description of the latest version of\u00a0Bitbucket Server & Bitbucket Data Center, see the\u00a0[release notes|https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/bitbucket-server-6-6-release-notes-975023322.html].\u00a0You can download the latest version of\u00a0Bitbucket Server from the\u00a0[download center.|https://www.atlassian.com/software/bitbucket/download]\r\n\r\n*Fix*:\r\n* Bitbucket Server & Bitbucket Data Center 6.6.1 contains a fix available for download from [here|https://www.atlassian.com/software/bitbucket/download/]\r\n\r\n* Bitbucket Server & Bitbucket Data Center 6.6.0 contains a fix available for download from [here|https://www.atlassian.com/software/bitbucket/download-archives]\r\n\r\n* Bitbucket Server & Bitbucket Data Center 6.5.2 contains a fix available for download from [here|https://www.atlassian.com/software/bitbucket/download-archives]\r\n\r\n* Bitbucket Server & Bitbucket Data Center 6.4.3 contains a fix available for download from [here|https://www.atlassian.com/software/bitbucket/download-archives]\r\n\r\n* Bitbucket Server & Bitbucket Data Center 6.3.5 contains a fix available for download from [here|https://www.atlassian.com/software/bitbucket/download-archives]\r\n\r\n* Bitbucket Server & Bitbucket Data Center 6.2.6 contains a fix available for download from [here|https://www.atlassian.com/software/bitbucket/download-archives]\r\n\r\n* Bitbucket Server & Bitbucket Data Center 6.1.8 contains a fix available for download from [here|https://www.atlassian.com/software/bitbucket/download-archives]\r\n\r\n* Bitbucket Server & Bitbucket Data Center 6.0.10 contains a fix available for download from [here|https://www.atlassian.com/software/bitbucket/download-archives]\r\n\r\n* Bitbucket Server & Bitbucket Data Center 5.16.10 contains a fix available for download from [here|https://www.atlassian.com/software/bitbucket/download-archives]\r\n\r\nh3. *Mitigation*\r\n\r\nTo help mitigate the issue, we have a hotfix available in the form of a plugin that can be enabled with zero downtime. You do not require the hotfix if you are already on a fixed version of Bitbucket, and the hotfix will refuse to install on any fixed version.\r\n{panel:bgColor=#ffffce}\r\nThe hotfix works for Bitbucket Server and Bitbucket Data Center instances and can be used to protect systems while planning and executing an upgrade to a fixed version.\r\n\r\nPlease note that installed apps may still introduce vulnerabilities, even with the hotfix installed. The hotfix only protects the _standard_ _functionality_ of Bitbucket.\r\n{panel}\r\n*This hotfix covers:*\r\n * Standard Bitbucket functionality and features\r\n * Bitbucket Server and Data Center versions 4.0.0 and later\r\n * Bitbucket Server and Data Center instances\r\n\r\nh4. To install the hotfix:\r\n\r\nThis hotfix is a _zero down time installation_ - No restart is required after installing the hotfix.\r\n # Login to Bitbucket with your administrator account\r\n # Go to Administration (cog wheel) and navigate to \u201cAddons\u201d \u2192 \u201cManage apps\u201c\r\n # Select \u201cUpload App\u201d and provide the URL:\u00a0{{[^bitbucket-bserv-11896-hotfix-1.0.0.jar]}}\r\n # Click \u201cUpload\u201d and wait for the hotfix to install.\r\n\r\nIf you are unable to upload the hotfix with the URL provided or Bitbucket is behind a firewall, you can download the hotfix plugin Jar from this issue. You are then able to upload the Jar file using the same steps above.\r\n\r\nAfter upgrading to a fixed version there\u2019s no need to remove the hotfix manually; it will be uninstalled automatically as part of the upgrade process.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nFor additional details, see the [full advisory|https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/Czc4Og].",

There are no single backups of this repository and no developers have a local clone of this repository. Even if there were a local clone, the metadata associated with the repository (configuration, pull requests, etc.) are not available to be restored.\r\nh2. Possible solutions\r\nh3. Mark as deleted\r\n\r\nMark a repository as deleted and keep all metadata and the repository on disk intact but inaccessible.\r\n - A server or system administrator could then go ahead and permanently delete any such repositories; or\r\n - A scheduled cleanup could be performed on a configurable timeout (e.g. automatically clean up repositories that are marked as deleted after 60 days)\r\n\r\nh3. Delete with backup\r\n\r\nPrior to the actual deletion of a repository, automatically create a backup of the current state of the repository and make this accessible to download to administrators.\r\n - A server or system administrator could then permanently delete this backup once they have a local copy or it is no longer needed.\r\n - A scheduled cleanup could be performed on a configurable timeout to delete old backup files.\r\n\r\nh2. Related issues and information\r\n\r\nIf you'd like more information about restoring an accidentally deleted repository, please\u00a0[read our knowledge base article|https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserverkb/restore-a-deleted-repository-for-bitbucket-server-942841062.html]\u00a0about this, however note that it requires a backup of some sort to be available, either in the form of a proper backup or a local clone of the repository.\r\n\r\nNote that there is a very similar feature request open for restoring a repository and all its details from a backup. This issue is specifically about Bitbucket Server preserving the data and state of a repository in some way upon deletion so that it can be seamlessly restored without the use of an external backup.\r\n\r\nThere are\u00a0[several recommended and supported backup strategies|https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/data-recovery-and-backups-776640050.html], please be sure to use the right backup strategy for your individual needs.",

Workaround\r\n\r\nImplement a URL rewrite on a reverse proxy to redirect URLs made using the partially duplicated paths over to the actual, correct, path. Something akin to matching the following regex:\r\n\r\n* {{^/rest/api/([0-9][.]?[0-9]?)/api/[0-9][.]?[0-9]?/(.*)$}}\r\n\r\nAnd then replacing it with:\r\n\r\n* {{/rest/api/$1/$2}}\r\n\r\n(!) Note: If you're using a context path, make sure to include that in the URL rewrite - both in the matching regex, and the redirect value as well\r\n\r\nWhile this workaround doesn't affect the incorrect display in the WADL file, it will ensure that any requests to the REST API will be redirected correctly to the same API; and allowing integrations using the WADL to function correctly (such as the REST API browser).",
