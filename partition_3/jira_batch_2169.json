This was a major feature for us, and a significant factor in choosing Crucible over other code review systems.\n\nWhat we used to be able to do was to create a review, browse Confluences as a 'repository', and select the pages we wanted to review. If a reviewer had a comment, then in Crucible they could insert that comment right at the lines/paras that the comment applied to - i.e. exactly like source code. It also meant we could review design docs and code alongside each other.{quote}\n\nAs noted [here|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CRUCIBLE/Crucible+2.7+Upgrade+Guide] the plugin was unbundled from Crucible 2.7 as it was made to work with Wiki Markup.\n\nTo return, a version would need to be created which supported the new Storage Format.",

(v. 6) --  N\u00e4chste Version anzeigen >> {quote}\n\nwhich is obviously incorrect - how could I view an old version (1st line) AND view the current version (last line) at the same time? I guess, the last line shall mean \"you're currently viewing version 6\".\n\nMoreover, I do not see the point of the block \"v. <pagename>\" in line 1. I would understand \"v. <version>\" but this would double the last line?! \n\nThe text displayed in an older version, from around 1 year ago, was really useful: There was a hint telling me which version I was currently viewing AND there was a link \"show latest version\" or the like. This was clear and made sense and enabled me to jump to lastest version with only 1 click. Hope you wanna have a look at the older versions :)",

Furthermore since there is no more editor that lets you go back and forth between markup and rich text there is no easy way to preview your markup short of copy pasting from textedit to a wiki page, testing, goign back to textedit, making changes, re pasting, re previewing. yuck.
