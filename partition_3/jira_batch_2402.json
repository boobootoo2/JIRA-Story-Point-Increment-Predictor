Hence the need of \"flagging\" al I.C. oriented repositories. \r\n\u00a0\r\nOne simple approach will be to add the \"Infrastructure as Code\" option to the Languages selection box, another approach could  be to include an additional field or a tagging mechanism for the repository metadata structure.\r\n\r\n\r\n ",
