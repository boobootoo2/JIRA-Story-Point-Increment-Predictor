The link will be in the form of {{#filePath/filename?f=123}} for the \"from\" side of the diff (context and removed lines) and {{#filePath/filename?t=123}}  for the the \"to\" side of the diff (added lines)\r\n\r\n !screenshot-2.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nYou can find more information in the Bitbucket Server 7.0\u00a0[release notes|https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/bitbucket-server-7-0-release-notes-990546638.html] and Pull Requests [documentation|https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/review-and-discuss-a-pull-request-808488540.html].\r\n\r\nPlease, don't hesitate to leave feedback on the feature in the comments. This will help us to priorities further development.\r\n\r\nMichael McGlynn\r\n Bitbucket Server Developer\r\n{panel}\r\nSometimes I want to refer to another line or function in a comment I\u2019m making on a commit or PR. It\u2019d be great if Stash added some way to generate a link to another line (or even a function, by name) inside of the Markdown syntax for comments.\r\n\r\nPerhaps something like:\r\n\r\nSee #345old.\r\n\r\nWhere `old` is used to designate the line relative to the file that\u2019s being patched, and `new` would refer to the line relative to the file as it would be after the diff is applied.",

It also does not tell you the change in filename path unless you hover over the `MOVED` label in the right-hand panel\r\n\r\nThis isn't a big deal if you just have a few files. But we just did a reorg where we moved about 100 files, so it's a LOT of work to click on each one and see \"oh, that's just a move\" for 95 of those 100 files but find the 5 files that have actually had changes as well as a move.\r\n\r\n*There needs to be a better way to see diffs where there are a large number of moved files, without having to click on them one at a time.*\r\n\r\n- *Please add a quick indicator in the left-hand panel to distinguish files that have changed from files that have not changed.* (because they've been moved, in the latter case)\r\n- *Please add a better indicator of move events* so it is possible to see the source and destination path more easily for a large set of moved files.

When given a value, they now encode it if required, but don't decode it again when the value is read back out. This causes our file tree to mismatch the hash against the file name and fail to find the selected file since it is comparing the decoded version against the encoded one.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nIf you are comfortable setting flags in your browser, you can set {{dom.url.getters_decode_hash}} to {{true}} as a temporary workaround. This flag can be set by visiting the URL \"about:config\", confirming that you understand the implications, searching for \"dom.url.getters_decode_hash\", and double-clicking the {{false}} value cell. *NOTE: once the issue is fixed in Bitbucket Server, you will have to set this flag back to {{false}} to avoid seeing similar errors with filenames that are already percent-encoded.*\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\n\r\nThe newest stable version of Firefox (41) can't switch files in a commit or pull request file tree when one of the files contains spaces.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.

Summary\r\n\r\nBitbucket Server users are able to push a SSH2 key type to a repo as an \"Access Key\"\r\n\r\n!http://monosnap.com/image/IK3yp1QT1iZ9WrbfAAIiuJPgXUtGZ5.png|height=200!\r\n\r\nIn certain scenario (we couldn't reproduce it yet), a customer reported that Stash will strangely assign the push to the {{---- END SSH2 PUBLIC KEY ----}} user that does not exist in the system but only as part of the SSH2 key type.\r\n!Pull request.PNG|height=300!\r\n\r\n*How does Stash do it?*\r\n\r\nWhen a Stash/Bitbucket server user pushes to a repo using SSH, the PR will register the changed pushed by the email address that is used _in the SSH_. This email will be mapped against the email address of a Stash/Bitbucket Server user and his/her username will be shown.\r\n\r\nIn the example above, Stash/Bitbucket Server that mapping seems to happen incorrectly due to this bug.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nWe could only reproduce the fact that Stash/Bitbucket Server accepts the upload of SSH2 key type. However, in our documentation we don't guide the users to use that.\r\n# [Create SSH keys|https://confluence.atlassian.com/stash/creating-ssh-keys-420973584.html#notfound]\r\n# [Convert them to SSH2 type|https://burnz.wordpress.com/2007/12/14/ssh-convert-openssh-to-ssh2-and-vise-versa/]. I used the following command:\r\n{noformat}\r\nssh-keygen -e -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub > ~/.ssh/id_rsa_ssh2.pub\r\n{noformat}\r\n# Upload the content of {{id_rsa_ssh2.pub}} to Stash/Bitbucket\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nStash/Bitbucket Server will reject the key.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nStash/Bitbucket Server accepts the key.\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\nDo not use SSH2 keys in Bitbucket Server.\r\nIf that was the case and you had pushes using SSH incorrectly assigned to the {{---- END SSH2 PUBLIC KEY ----}} user in PR updates that you want to be fixed, please raise an issue with https://support.atlassian.com",

E.g from 7.9.0 -> 7.9.1. We know that for those of you who stay on versions of Bitbucket for longer periods, particularly LTS releases, this will allow you to easily keep patched without downtime. \r\n\r\nYou can read more about it in the release notes [here|https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/bitbucket-server-and-data-center-7-9-release-notes-1037993528.html] and see an overview of an end to end upgrade experience on our Data Center Video Library page [here|https://www.atlassian.com/enterprise/data-center/data-center-video-library].\r\n\r\nWe're not stopping here though. We're continuing to investigate how we can eliminate further downtime and look forward to giving more concrete updates on this in the near future.\r\n\r\nAs always, if you'd like to be involved in feedback sessions, we'd love to speak to you. Please reach out at rsaunders at atlassian dot com\r\n\r\n Rob Saunders\r\n Product Manager - Data Center\r\n{panel}\r\n*Original Description:*\r\n Currently it is not possible to upgrade Bitbucket Data Center with zero downtime, as the cluster never allows nodes with mixed versions.\r\n\r\nIf upgrade tasks between versions allow it, it should be possible to upgrade Bitbucket Data Center one node at a time, so that there is little or no loss of availability during the upgrade process.",

After upgrading to 4.0.1, our code broke because this information is now in the \"properties\" key, not the \"attributes\" key.  Is this a bug?  Hard to say because the documentation is completely silent on the issue.  The \"attributes\"/\"properties\" are completely undocumented, and do not show up in the GET example for /pull-requests.  Likewise for the distinction between {{withAttributes}} and {{withProperties}}.  Which compels us to wonder whether this functionality is even supported by Atlassian.\r\n\r\nIf it's really unsupported, you can just close this issue, and we won't rely on it.

      "description": "{panel}\r\n(i) *This is a particular pain point for our customers upgrading from Stash to Bitbucket Server with an environment which is running Java 7*\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nh3. Summary\r\n\r\nWhen Bitbucket Server fails to start because the running JVM set in the env variable {{JAVA_HOME}} is _not supported_ or is _incorrect_, the messaging is logged to {{<CATALINA_HOME>/catalina.out}} and the console output says it started successfully.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Setup a server with {{JAVA_HOME}} ( in {{/etc/environment}} or similar location) pointing to Java 7 or incorrectly set to the {{bin}} directory (i.e. {{/usr/lib/jvm/oracle_jdk8/bin/java}})\r\n# Install Stash {{3.x}}\r\n# Upgrade to Bitbucket Server\r\n# Start Bitbucket using {{$ sudo service atlbitbucket start}}\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n- The console output informs the user that the configured JVM is not supported and they must upgrade in order to run Bitbucket Server\r\n*OR*\r\n- The application starts using its embedded JRE as opposed to an invalid or unsupported {{JAVA_HOME}}\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nBitbucket Server tells the user the application started successfully. The messaging about the incompatible JRE is logged to {{catalina.out}} which is easy to miss for our customers producing support load.\r\n\r\n{code:title= Output when you start Bitbucket as a service}\r\n$ sudo service atlbitbucket start\r\nTo run Bitbucket in the foreground, start the server with start-bitbucket.sh -fg\r\nStarting Atlassian Bitbucket as dedicated user atlbitbucket\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nBitbucket is being run with a umask that contains potentially unsafe settings.\r\nThe following issues were found with the mask \"u=rwx,g=rwx,o=rx\" (0002):\r\n - access is allowed to 'others'. It is recommended that 'others' be denied\r\n   all access for security reasons.\r\n - write access is allowed to 'group'. It is recommend that 'group' be\r\n   denied write access. Read access to a restricted group is recommended\r\n   to allow access to the logs.\r\n\r\nThe recommended umask for Bitbucket is \"u=,g=w,o=rwx\" (0027) and can be\r\nconfigured in setenv.sh\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nUsing BITBUCKET_HOME:      /var/atlassian/application-data/stash\r\nUsing CATALINA_BASE:   /opt/atlassian/bitbucket/4.0.0\r\nUsing CATALINA_HOME:   /opt/atlassian/bitbucket/4.0.0\r\nUsing CATALINA_TMPDIR: /opt/atlassian/bitbucket/4.0.0/temp\r\nUsing JRE_HOME:        /usr/lib/jvm/jre\r\nUsing CLASSPATH:       /opt/atlassian/bitbucket/4.0.0/bin/bitbucket-bootstrap.jar:/opt/atlassian/bitbucket/4.0.0/bin/bootstrap.jar:/opt/atlassian/bitbucket/4.0.0/bin/tomcat-juli.jar\r\nUsing CATALINA_PID:    /opt/atlassian/bitbucket/4.0.0/work/catalina.pid\r\nTomcat started.\r\n\r\nSuccess! You can now use Bitbucket at the following address:\r\n\r\nhttp://localhost:7990/\r\n\r\nIf you cannot access Bitbucket at the above location within 3 minutes, or encounter any other issues starting or stopping Atlassian Bitbucket, please see the troubleshooting guide at:\r\n\r\nhttps://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BitbucketServerKB/Troubleshooting+Installation\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n*Error in case of incompatibility with Java 1.7:*\r\n{noformat:title=<Bitbucket_Install>/logs/catalina.out} \r\nAtlassian Bitbucket does not support Java 1.7.0_85. Please start the product with Java 8 or greater.\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\n*Error in case of Java incorrectly set:*\r\n{noformat:title=<Bitbucket_Install>/logs/catalina.out} \r\n./catalina.sh: 1: eval: /usr/lib/jvm/oracle_jdk8/bin/java: not found\r\n./catalina.sh: 1: eval: /usr/lib/jvm/oracle_jdk8/bin/java: not found\r\n./atlassian/bitbucket/bin/catalina.sh: 1: eval: /usr/lib/jvm/oracle_jdk8/bin/java: not found\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nh3. Possible Workaround\r\n\r\nRemoving a globally set {{JAVA_HOME}} would resolve the issue as well as the application will fallback to the bundled JRE, however this may not be an option for some of our customers as they might have other applications using their current {{JAVA_HOME}} value.\r\n\r\nh3.Solution\r\n\r\nInstall Java 8 and set it as your {{JAVA_HOME}}. More details on how to set up your {{JAVA_HOME}} can be found on step #2 of the following document:\r\n- [Install Bitbucket Server from an archive file|https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/install-bitbucket-server-from-an-archive-file-776640148.html]\r\n",

If there is only 1 entry, it gets improperly renamed to lose the corresponding ID.\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\nThis was tested with MS SQL Server 2012.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# In Stash 3.x, enable auto merging in the branching model for 2 repositories.\r\n# Perform an upgrade to Bitbucket Server 4.0.0.\r\n# Bitbucket Server fails to start.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nBitbucket Server upgrades the database schema correctly.\r\n\r\nh3.

Possible Side-effects if you did NOT encounter this issue on upgrade\r\n\r\nIf you upgraded to 4.0.0, and did not encounter the unique key constraint violation, and had auto-merge enabled on any repositories, then your auto-merge settings will have been silently truncated (by chopping the last decimal digit off every repo id). This will result in the auto-merge settings being applied to different repositories and removed from the repository it was set on.\r\nAs this silent truncation has lost information, we are unable to provide any automated upgrade task to recover it. \r\nWe suggest retrieving the lost information from your backup taken prior to the upgrade of 4.0.0, and re-enabling the auto-merge settings for those repositories.\r\n\r\n",
