This is an important information. I suggest adding the line in bold to this paragraph:\r\n{quote}\r\nFor example, if you are using the JIRA Software Development workflow, you may consider work to have started on an issue when it transitions to 'In Progress' and work to have completed when it transitions out of 'In Review' (to 'Done'). You would show this on the Control Chart by selecting 'In Progress' and 'In Review' as the Columns, as that would show the time that issues have spent in those two statuses. *The time spent in each Columns is only updated once the issue has left it.*\r\n{quote}\r\n# The documentation uses a lot the term 'time spent', which in this case refers to time spent in columns, but in JIRA, this has another meaning, which is the time spent in worklogs.

Problem Definition\r\nIn JIRA Agile, when creating an issue for a project different than the current one, you get a message saying {{Your issue XX-XX has been created but is not currently visible}} and it doesn't give you a reason why it's not showing. This issue gets excluded from the current board and doesn't appear in the backlog.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nIt would be useful to have a tool similar to the _Permissions Helper_, so we can insert the name of the issue and know why the filter is excluding from the current board.\r\n \r\nh3. Workaround \r\nThere are two possible workarounds:\r\n- Go to the actual Project where you created the issue and look for it in the backlog. In some cases you'll need to clear the filters for it to apply.\r\n- Modify the board's filter as per [Configuring filters|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/AGILE/Configuring+Filters].",

      "description": "If I'm looking at an epic, one of the things I often want to do is look at all the issues in the epic in the issue navigator and then filter on them.  \r\n\r\nFor example, today I wanted to check that none of the issues in my epic are in the \"Needs Triage\" state, that stops them being on the rapid board we use.  I spent way too long trying to figure out how to do this without going to the issue navigator and then using JQL.  \r\n\r\nI think an appropriate place for this would be the little dropdown that you get for Sub-Tasks.  I know that epics don't currently have that dropdown, but obviously they should.  An issue with a collection of issues in it should probably list the issues the same way by default.  I can't immediately think why the sub-task list should contain \"Show All\" and \"Show Open\" menu options but the \"Issues in Epic list shouldn't\".  My guess is just different developers.\r\n",

Time chosen is prior to the estimate change on the issue\r\n** Time selected might be start of day, start of business day, or perhaps the start of the kickoff meeting\r\n* JIRA Agile reports on the estimate that existed on the sprint start date instead of using the estimate that is present on the issue when the sprint is started\r\n\r\n",
