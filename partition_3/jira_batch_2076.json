Now we have reached the point where My Calendar loading takes more than 15 seconds in Team Calendars is actually gets unusable.\n\nI searched the bug tracker for similar issues and I see that such problem is well know by developers but so far there is only promise that it will be fixed in next major version(for example, TEAMCAL-1911, TEAMCAL-485).\n\nIt is completely unacceptable - the product which we have bought is UNUSABLE, so this issue has to be treated with the highest priority!\nI understand that the fix can not be trivial, so it makes sense to plan it for next major version, but in such case you have to provide us with some workaround - for example, DB tuning scripts, scripts to remove the old events etc.",

But as soon as I add, there's a timeout right above the calendar itself and the Issue Dates never load. So I go back to Jira and enable ical 1.1 again. After that, Issue Dates are displayed on the Calendar properly.\n\nh4.Steps to Reproduce: \n\n# Install Team Calendars 4.0.3.1 in Confluence\n# Install Jira iCalendar plugin version 1.1 (latest one)\n# Create a new Calendar in Team Calendars\n# After created, click on \"Add Event\" option in the Calendar name (the arrow in the right side of the screen)\n# Try to pick an JIRA even (Jira Project Releases, in example)\n# You will receive a timeout error displayed in red in the \"Create Even\" screen not allowing you to proceed.",

We have created a big calendar system with about 15 different calendars. When we tried to subscribe to some of these calendars using Outlook it has been having trouble linking to the calendar. \n\nUnfortunately it seems to be different things that are causing the break in different calendars. I have one calendar called \"Private Sector Buildings\" and this subscription works fine, until I change the color of the calendar (and nothing else) and then it breaks. I have another calendar called \"Delta Cities\" and this one works fine if you change the color, but breaks if you try to edit the name of the calendar and nothing else. \n\nI have been trying to add the calendars through the Online Microsoft Portal and through Outlook 2007 and both of them have been having problems. \n\nI have been testing and have not been able to find why it is causing these problems. I cant find any one correlating thing that is causing this problem, it seems that for different calendars different things are causing this subscription break. \n\nI wish I had more information on this, but I wanted to pass on that I was having this problem.\n\nThanks,\nDaniel ",

Situation\r\n- You can't see Calendars with restricted viewing.\r\n- When the restriction is exclusive to editing you still can't see who has the permissions to edit.\r\n- There's no way to recover permissions over a calendar.\r\n\r\nh3. Notes \r\n\r\nDifferently from server admins, Cloud admins can't check/change those restrictions through the database.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nAn administration interface where Confluence administrators can search and edit calendar permissions similar to the *restricted pages* interface in every space but globally for calendars\r\n\r\n",

Currently we can see the issue key and the summary and that is frequently useful. But what we would like is the ability to choose what shows up in the \"event cell\", i.e., we might like to display the summary and the assignee, or, the summary and the component, etc. It also seems like we should be able to choose what shows in the cell under normal conditions, and, what shows during a hover.\n\nI'm sure you already have this in the queue for a future release.\n\nThanks for the great product!",

All other views render the custom events just all the default event types.\n\nThanks!",
