Here&#x27;s the scenario:\n\nSuppose that when a pipeline runs and all my tests within have passed, I like to tag the associated commit in Bitbucket. Naturally, this means my Docker container has to have a private key written to it, which is not a problem. I use the suggested technique of having an environment variable store the obfuscated key, then:\n\numask 077 - echo $MY_SSH_KEY | base64 --decode > ~/.ssh/id_rsa\n\nSo, no problem there. I now have the ability to push back to my repo. Great. But, here&#x27;s the issue:\n\nNow suppose I allow people to fork and make PRs. If I merge in an outside party&#x27;s PR (after a review, obviously), I risk having malicious code in my repo. This code could, say, send all the environment variables in the Docker container within a unit test. So, some outside party could get my SSH key.\n\nQUESTION:\n\n* is there a way to limit what environment variables make it to what BP steps\n* if not, could this be an included feature...or...\n* maybe I&#x27;m on the wrong track all together?\n\nActually, one thing I just realized I could do is:\n\n* break the pipeline up into steps that have share a built artifact\n* in the step that does the test and build, the first line would be to erase the environment variable\n* the step that does the tagging would do the id_rsa write above (instead of erasing the environment variable)\n\nDid I just solve my own problem?",

Currently the package gives an 500 when requesting projects.\n\n*Check*\\\\\nhttps://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/teams/swisnl/projects vs https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/teams/swisnl/projects/\\\\\\\nI found out while using the api through a package, see issue here: https://github.com/BitbucketAPI/Client/issues/15\\\\\\\nThis also appearantly is the issue for pipelines. See https://github.com/BitbucketAPI/Client/pull/7\n\nThe awnser on this was this was by design, i quote:\n\nbq. This is actually an expected behavior and by design,  the reason behind this is collections end point should have a trailing slash at the end, however individual end point resource doesn&#x27;t.\n\n\nBut there a lot of endpoints which accept both, which makes for a very confusing developer experience. Personally i&#x27;d say, make all endpoint accept with and without slash, as you would expect. Some examples of weird endpoints:\n\n*Possble problems*\\\\\nhttps://developer.atlassian.com/bitbucket/api/2/reference/resource/repositories/%7Busername%7D/%7Brepo_slug%7D\n\nAlso accepts a trailing slash: https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/swisnl/eighty/\n\nThis accepts both: https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/swisnl/eighty/refs/tags/ and https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/swisnl/eighty/refs/tags\n\nSo really, shouldn&#x27;t all endpoints just accept both then, for consistency? Since now random endpoints don&#x27;t accept the trailing slash, which is quite confusing.\n\nCould there please be a consistent way to talk to your endpoint? This would make checking all endpoints for what they support unneeded.\n\nThanks.",

When i hit the 2gb limit on my repos, there seems to be no way to remove files to shrink it down. It won&#x27;t let me directly remove them from the repository, nor make a commit which removes them. Then when i went to the suggested page which says how to shrink it up, it was an overwhelming amount of BS so I said screw that and just deleted and re-added my repository. This a takes a while, and took a while to come to this conclusion, so i wasted what could be been a productive evening dealing with this BS.\n\nThe only reason I can think of why you would make it so difficult is you want to pressure free users into buying. Well, you have almost pressured me into leaving. You should rethink this strategy if that was your strategy, as one voiced complaint represent X amount of unvoiced complaints. You are not painting the image of a product I would want to buy. The restriction itself is fine, but causing my repository to grind to a halt with little I can do to correct except to follow the bizarre and unwieldly instructions you set forth, is unacceptable to me.\n\nMy suggestion, just allow commits which remove files, or allow removing files directly from the repository web site to clean it up.",
