[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-9458].\n  {panel}\n\nI very frequently have my page titles rejected by Confluence because it contains an illegal character, typically a colon or a slash. This drives me and my team batty! There are old issues regarding this problem that have been closed (CONF-253 and CONF-4238) and I couldn't find a way to reopen them, so I'm making this new one.\n\nThis is especially bad for blogs. I use Confluence to write my internal blog, and I'm constantly wanting to use a title like this one (from Jonathan Nolen's blog):\n\nConfluence Massive: Clustered Wiki\nhttp://blogs.atlassian.com/news/2007/01/confluence_mass.html\n\nI'm not sure what restrictions (if any) blog titles have, but it would be ideal if Confluence wasn't more restrictive. For example, we were considering migrating a blog into Confluence, but a number of the titles would not have translated well.\n\nHaving said this, page titles still cause a problem. Some examples of page titles I couldn't create if I wanted to:\n\n   AC/DC\n   2001: A Space Odyssey\n  Meeting Notes: Team Meeting 10/20/2007\n\nI'm sure I don't understand all the issues, but here are some thoughts:\n\nThere already is logic where certain pages use an id URL when invalid characters are included, so that means that there should never be restrictions on characters that are restricted in URL syntax. Primarily this means that '/' should be straightforward to support in titles. Of course, I may be missing something!\n\nI imagine the real issue is that the Wiki syntax makes special use of these characters. I wonder if titles could be escaped in those sitations. This wouldn't be a problem for people using the link button, but it would make life more annoying for someone just typing in a name. Since slash is not part of the Wiki syntax, that shouldn't be an issue. However, I see that colon is definitely more problematic. Depending upon how strict the parsing is, you could special case links to interpret the colon in both senses.\n\ne.g.   [Confluence Massive:Clustered Wiki] could interpret as a link first, but if such a page does not exist then it would interpret it as a space directive. Of course, there are many macros that interpret links that would have to be fixed (including my Metadata Plugin) so maybe escaping is a better solution. For blogs it is less of an issue, as it is almost impossible for a normal user to link to one!\n\nSupporting [ and ] in titles is less important for me, and I could see would have similar parser problems. However, if a general purpose escaping scheme was implemented, then I would suggest that titles should be completely unrestricted. A wiki is meant to be issue to use, and it is very irritating when you can't create the title you need. ",

It would need to include the space key if the colour scheme is changed at space level or just empty if global level?\n\nI've attached a collage of some of the cool effects that we can now do in Builder 3.0 simply by altering the Confluence colour scheme - no graphics were changed, just the \"top bar\" and \"menu bar\" colours :) It's just a shame that the end-user has to clear their browser cache (or the theme designer has to make a \"fake\" change to their layout) to force the CSS to be re-loaded after the colours are changed.\n\nGuy ",

It is a simply copy of the html login form + a parameter to the return page when logged in:\n\n{code}\n<form method=\"POST\" action=\"login.action\" name=\"loginform\">\n  <div align=\"center\"><div style=\"width: 500px;\"><div style=\"text-align: left;\">\n    <br>\n    <div class=\"form-header\">\n      <p>Enter your account details below to login to the A-Server Customer Portal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"form-block\">\n      <p><div class=\"steplabel\" style=\"width: 150px;\"><u>U</u>sername: </div><input type=\"text\" name=\"os_username\" tabindex=\"1\" accesskey=\"U\" size=\"30\"><br/></p>\n      <p><div class=\"steplabel\" style=\"width: 150px;\"><u>P</u>assword: </div><input type=\"password\" name=\"os_password\" tabindex=\"2\" accesskey=\"P\" size=\"30\"><br/></p>\n      <p>\n        <div class=\"steplabel\" style=\"width: 150px;\"><input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"os_cookie\" id=\"os_cookie_id\" value=\"true\" tabindex=\"3\"/></div>\n        <label for=\"os_cookie_id\" accesskey=\"r\"><u>R</u>emember my login on this computer</label>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"form-buttons\">\n      <input id=\"loginButton\" name=\"login\" type=\"submit\" value=\"Log In\" tabindex=\"4\"/>\n    </div>\n    <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"os_destination\" value=\"/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=CORP&title=$param0\"/>\n   <div class=\"form-block\">\n     <div style=\"float:right;\">\n       <p><a href=\"/forgotuserpassword.action\">Forgot password?</a></p>\n     </div>\n   </div>\n   </div></div></div>\n</form>\n{code}\n\nusage: {code}{loginform:returnpage}{code}\n\nI also copied the css to theme builder custom css. The form works perfectly fine unless I type a wrong password.\nWhen this happens I get a *HTTP Status 405 - HTTP method POST is not supported by this URL* (from Apache Tomcat/5.5.15)\nIs there a way to evade this problem and send the user to a page which shows the loginform again and tells the user that he entered a wrong password? Or could this loginform macro be added as a new feature with some more possibilities, like a parameter were you can tell the form where to go when something went wrong?\n\nthx",

Recently WordDAV was added to the mix.  Each method has its merits and drawbacks as well as ideosyncracies, so they don't play well together in the same page under many circumstances.   Just switching back between RTF and wiki markup modes has been known to cause havoc.\n\nI suggest what I hope to be a minor improvement that enables users who create pages more control over which method can be used to edit a page in order to avoid conflicts between editing techniques, causing reformatting errors,  wiki markup ceasing to function, or markup being inadvertently removed from the page.  It could be especially helpful to novices in certain environments\n\nFor RTF vs wiki markup, a user could set a new property of the page being edited that future edits would have to be done only with a particular method RTF or Wiki Markup.  The creator (and revisor ?) could also prohibit the remote API from updating a give page.  (The property would also prevent switching between editing modes.)  For 3rd party plugins, it probably becomes more difficult without the plugin author cooperating to implement a new feature, but the idea is the same.  For pages that are generated or edited through the remote API from such software as the Word AddIn, there would need to be a way for detecting (and setting ?) what was permissible.\n\nAn administrative enhancement might even allow global and space administrators to set a property that determines which method(s) are permitted by default.\n\nThis improvement could potentially mitigate many problems users are having by enabling them to work around issues instead of Atlassian trying to identify and fix many open issues that are currently in this Editing issue section one by one.",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-9268].\n  {panel}\n\nThe search capability of Confluence is starting to fall behind that offered by many commercial knowledge products.  In particular there is no ability in Confluence to specify synonym rings (a ring is a set of terms which have equivalent meaning - a term meaning a word or a phrase).  This is useful for many reasons in particular knowledge domains (for example a user could enter either an acronym or its equivalent long form or other predefined synonym into the search box and the indexed Content Entity Objects would return documents that contain any of them).  Also there is no ability to predetermine that certain Content Entity Objects  are always matched to particular search terms in order to guarantee that desired content is returned if someone uses a particular search term.  There are no extensions employed by Confluence to allow search to provide faceted search capabilities (for example, see [http://drupal.org/project/faceted_search] or SOLR )\n\nThese features are important to enhancing the functionality of knowledgebases and providing users with more fine tuned search capability that, if used skillfully, are more likely to produce useful and quick access to content for the average non-technical user without having to be a search query guru.\n\nThese features should be implemented in search in such a way that they can be configured per space or globally and that plugins such as metadata and advanced search can take advantage of the added features, being able to extend or modify their behavior for particular purposes.\n\nFinally, there should be the option to index rendered wiki pages such that wiki markup is never shown to the user in search results.\n\nMake custom metadata (ala metadata plugin) capability and metadata reporting/searching an integrated part of the base Confluence product\n\nIncorporate these features into the Remote SOAP interface.\n\nThe features should be configurable primarily by either site and/or space administrators depending on scope.\n\nSome of these features have various open source implementations that are demonstrated or have become commercial products.  Products such as Sharepoint 2007 and others have implemented some of these features or are rumored to be adding them in the near future.\n\nNote: I was reminded that this is probably too broad for a feature request.  I apologize for that.  I just wanted to tie a lot of related aspects of the search improvements I was requesting together (as a wish list).",

These allow the plugin to specify which versions of the product is should work on. However, none of our products actually do anything with this data, so most plugin authors just ignore it.\n\nHowever, after disucssion with Jeff, we came to the conclusion that we should start respecting the minVersion attribute, and not enable a plugin that violates this constraint. This will help cut down on support cases where people try to install a plugin known not to work.\n\nWe also decided NOT to do the same thing for maxVersion, as it would make upgrades much less smooth, *forcing* all plugins to be upgraded for a new Confluence version, even if they did need to be.\n\nThe basic behaviour should be that when we attempt to load a plugin, we check for the config attribute, and if we violate the constraint, we return an error message to the user.",

This would especially be great for Confluence installations with public signup enabled. For example, taking Atlassian's own Confluence - there is nothing to prevent users from signing up with a username such as \"atlassian\", or \"atlassian.sales\", or \"atlassian.staff\", etc (not to mention rude words). Similarly with full names - there is nothing to prevent a user from changing their name to \"Atlassian Staff\" and such.\n\nAs far as I can tell, the only ways that the problem can currently be avoided for usernames are either disabling public signup, or painstakingly creating users with disallowed usernames (not ideal as they would count toward licenses - also a problem if a 'disallowed' username authors content before it is picked up).\n\nFor full names the problem is even worse, as anybody can change their name at any time and there is nothing preventing multiple people from choosing the same name. For example, 20 people could all change their full name to \"Atlassian Support\" regardless of whether they work at the company or not.\n\nThe blacklist should be ignored for administrators, perhaps with a warning/confirmation screen if their choice of username/full name is picked up by the blacklist.",

Also, send something out to confluence-developer@lists.atlassian.com saying the same.\n* Information on how to do upgrade a maven 1 project to maven 2 is here. It may need a little work, but I'd be happy to assist in maintaining it or providing whatever info I can to help get people started: http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DISC/Developing+Confluence+Plugins+with+Maven+2\n* Tell developers to add a profile similar to the following to their pom.xml which would look for a clover license file that would only exist on the build server (for example, in the java.home dir) and only runs this profile if that license exists:\n\n <project>\n   ...\n  <profiles>\n    <profile>\n      <id>atlassian-nightly-build</id>\n      <activation>\n        <file>\n          <exists>${java.home}/clover.license</exists>\n        </file>\n      </activation>\n      ...\n    </profile>\n  </profiles>\n  ...\n</project>\n",

Content that is only restricted to this user will become available to all confluence users. Are you sure you want to delete this user?\"\n\nThe thing that scares me about this is \"Content that is only restricted to this user will become available to all confluence users.\" One of the main reasons we bought Confluence was because certain documentation should be limited to one or more individuals.\n\nIf someone on our support team removes a user and by doing so opens up content that the user owned to everyone out there, this could expose sensitive information and cause huge headaches.\n\nA suggested alternative to this (which would work for bulk user deletes also) would be to show a table (could be paged) of the following when an administrator tries to remove one or more users and those users have content that only they have permissions to:\n\nTable column headings:\nUserid - Page (or Object that users has sole permissions to) - Reassign to Group/User\n\nReassign to Group/User cells under heading would contain a dropdown with values: \"User\" and \"Group\" and then an empty text field with a \"lookup\" button next to it.\n\nThen you could also have two links next to Reassign... for each row called \"reassign all for user\" (that will fill in the reassign field for all content solely owned by that user, and something at the top called \"reassign all\" (or similar) that lets you just bulk reassign everything (regardless of user who owns it) to a single user/group.\n\nI know that sounds like a lot, but I think that is one way to do it more safely. You might also state something like \"You should encourage your users to always have more than one person assigned to private content to avoid this page.\"",

I know that Jonathan posts these on the blog when they are known in advance and am very grateful for this, but this has bitten us several times now because I don't actively check Jonathan's blog. Having a simple status page to go to would suffice .Even better would be to have a mailing list for these developer services so that we could all get notifications when the servers are down/up and when they are planned to be down and maybe an RSS feed (although I personally don't use RSS feeds I know some that do).\n\nThanks,\nGary",

If they have not created any favourite pages or spaces yet, they will not be able to see where to go to do so.  Coupled with shortcomings in the Browse alphabetically (eg, no all pages, defaults to pages beginning with A, rather than all pages) and by hierarchy (treeview should default to expanded) functions which both hinder content navigation, this is a negative experience when trying to increase wiki adoption.  It is also usually one of the first obstacles a new user has to face, and, well, first impressions do last (especially with non-technical users) ...",

Tiny links have the advantage of being more stable for linking to confluence pages from other places (like JIRA).  Confluence does a pretty good job of re-directing old page names to new page names, but it is still adds extra steps to follow the links.  The nice thing about tiny links is that they survive refactoring of page names.  An example is using Confluence for program documentation and including links in JIRA issues and source code.  In particular, the smaller link is more convenient.\n\nI have customized .../pages/page-breadcrumbs.vm to include a small icon representing the tiny link.  Something like this would make the tiny link directly accessable without going to the INFO tab page.\n{noformat}\n\n#if (!$viewpagebreadcrumb)\n ...\n\n## Customize - put an easy to access tiny link on the page as icon following page name in breadcrumb line\n            #if ($tinyUrl)\n                <a href=\"$helper.domainName/x/$helper.tinyUrl\">\n                    <img src=\"/images/icons/docs_16.gif\" width=\"12\" height=\"12\" hspace=\"4\" vspace=\"1\" align=\"absmiddle\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Tiny link to current page.\" title=\"Tiny link to current page.\"/>\n                </a>\n            #end\n\n#end\n{noformat}",

So it would be very helpful if there were a way or hide or grey out the ability to do this in spaces/createspace-start.action without having to override the vm in confluence to do so. This could either be done through a properties file or via some new admin UI functionality.\n\nIn addition, it would be helpful to keep space admins and helpdesk (that are currently conf-admins so they can create spaces) from being able to change any anonymous permissions except view space and create comments. This would require a change to spaces/editspacepermissions.action?key=myspacekey\n\nCurrently we are already doing both of these things by overriding the confluence templates, but we'd rather be able to configure Confluence to do it instead.\n\nThanks!",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-9023].\n  {panel}\n\nScott F. was nice enough to suggest that I post this for consideration for a future release that addresses macros. \n\nTo summarize, disconnected numbering in Confluence today (2.5.4) can be problematic both in terms of keeping numbering from reverting to \"1.\" and in terms of keeping indentation correct. This is particularly a problem for documentation being created in Confluence because such doc is so dependent on ordered lists.\n\nWe've successfully implemented three macros that address this issue by exposing HTML numbering a little more directly. The macros are:\n\n|| macro || definition ||\n| setnumlst | <ol start=$param0 TYPE=$param1><li>$body</li>  |\n| lst | <li> |\n| endnumlst | </ol> |\n\nThus something like:\n\n{code}{setnumlst:3|A}Is this the third item in the list?{setnumlst}{code}\n\nWould appear as:\n\n{code}C. Is this the third item in the list?{code}\n\nand would be independent of any other numbering. \n\nHere's a little more elaborate example:\n\n{code}\nYou can inspect an existing key by:\n{setol:1|1}Opening the key schema file.{setol}\n\nh5. Inspecting a Key Schema\n\n!dsp30:images-datasrvc^Inspecting a Key Schema.gif|thumbnail!\n\n----\n{endol}\n{setol:2|1}Double-clicking on the key element.{setol}\n\nh5. Elements in a Key Element\n\n!dsp30:images-datasrvc^Key Elements in a Key Element.gif|thumbnail!\n{code}\n\nI'm attaching a picture of the result - the nice thing is that it isn't dependent on careful wikimarkup line spacing, etc. \n\nThanks for considering this. \n\nAlthough we've installed and used these macros, I wouldn't say that they have been extensively used by any means. If I discover any problems going forward I'll update this. Also, the names are probably problematic but I couldn't think of anything better. Cheers,",

One of the big spaces has a fixed tree structure. On certain tree levels we have moderators that are responsible for their area (means for all the pages below a certain page -  descendants).\nDue to the size of the area a moderator would like to see recently created and updated pages of his area. One of the options would be to use labels, but a lot of people do forget to label their pages and those pages should also be found and reviewed by the moderator.\nWe would like to have recently-updated macro supporting similar parameters like metadata-report macro: in particular root and pages options (http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CONFEXT/Metadata+Plugin#MetadataPlugin-Macrokeywords).\n\nUp to now, recently-updated macro is only usable for small spaces with a few edits.\n\nThanks,\n  Yuri",

Ideally, they would display a rolling 1-day/week/month view (as opposed to viewing on Sunday and having 6/7-ths set to 0 views/edits) as well as a better display (see attachment screenshots from web-metric tool Mint) In addition, the ability to drill and cross-reference statistics would be of great benefit. An example of this could be viewing all edits by me for a particular date, then clicking on a page I have edited to reveal all other used that have edited that page that day/week/month/ever. Clicking on another user would reveal the pages they have edited, etc. This would need, obviously, to be integrated with the permissions system somehow.",
