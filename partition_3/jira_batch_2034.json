Expected Results\r\n\r\nFull table is showing on the PDF file.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe table is not adjusted. Left of the table is truncated.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nManually set the maximum width of tables for the PDF export:\r\n # Go to *Space Tools > Look and Feel > PDF Stylesheet*\r\n # Edit the PDF Export Stylesheet and add these lines\r\n{code:java}\r\ntable\r\n{\r\n   table-layout:auto !important;\r\n   width: auto !important;\r\n   max-width: 90% !important\r\n}\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nNote that you would need to have space admin permission to perform the workaround.\r\nh3. Note\r\n\r\nIf your table is copied from other content to Confluence editor, the table might contain inline style like as below:\r\n{code:none}\r\n<table class=\"wrapped fixed-table\"><colgroup><col style=\"width: 310.0px;\" /><col style=\"width: 304.0px;\" /><col style=\"width: 313.0px;\" /><col style=\"width: 349.0px;\" /></colgroup>\r\n{code}\r\nYou can verify this by \"View Storage Format\" and search \"<table\" on the page. If this is your case, unfortunately, there's no easy way to tweak the rendering glitch.\r\n !Screenshot 2018-04-26 11.36.21.png|thumbnail! \r\n One of the ways to remove these styles is once export the page to word format and then import the word file to Confluence page. However, in many cases, you have to fix the alignment after importing the word file since these pages tend to contain complex elements.\r\n\r\nSee also [How to normalize HTML tags in page|https://confluence.atlassian.com/confkb/How+to+normalize+HTML+tags+in+page-953135631.html] for more detail.",

I had been to the page just before creating my document, so I opened by browsers back-button drop down and tried right-clicking, hoping it would give me a menu that would allow me copy the URL.\u00a0 Instead, it treated the click just like a left click... That's not your problem though. Your problem is that confluence didn't pop up anything saying \"Are you sure you want to leave\" page \u2013 I just went, discarding all my work. Having it be super easy to lose all my work makes me want a save frequently. But, instead of having a button I can click to save change, I need to publish my document and then edit it again and find where I was.\r\n\r\nYou make it easy to lose all your work and hard to save it. I think you have that backwards.\r\n\r\nWhich brings me to issue number two. There is a feedback button on the edit page, where I typed in a message roughly matching the one above and clicked \"give feedback\" ... Which resulted in a forever-spinning icon (After I got sick of staring at the spinning icon, I went outside and smoked. When I returned, it still had not submitted \u2013 so I let it go for at least 10 minutes). Since I was already trying to give you grumpy feedback, having the feedback button not work made me even more grumpy.\r\n\r\nWhich brings us to issue number three. I went to report the can't-give-feedback bug. After searching for duplicate bugs, I typed up my bug report and clicked \"create\" only to be greeted with an insufficient permissions to assign ownership message.\r\n\r\nIf I get another similar message when I try to give this feedback, I'm going to be pretty upset.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
