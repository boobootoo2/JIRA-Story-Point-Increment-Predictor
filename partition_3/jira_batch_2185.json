Something along the lines of \\{last-visited:spaces=@ALL|reverse=true|total=20\\} would show the 20 pages which haven't been visited for the longest time.  This could be put into some sort of system admin page/space/dashboard, and would allow administrators to find out which pages are no longer relevant or aren't being used, and be able to clean up or rectify as appropriate.\n\nI don't believe that this is currently available in confluence (did a quick google and a search of this JIRA), so could be a nice future feature!",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-19684].\n  {panel}\n\nOur confluence site currently hosts pages which are written in german, english and occassionaly spanish or russian. Everybody has its own take on how to put multiple languages on one page. Unfortunately there is no markup to specify a language for a content area. Also page titles would have to either respect this markup or use additional metadata.\n\nA macro in the style of {lang:de-DE} which displays content based on the users or default site language would probably be easy to implement. \n\nTextile however provides a nice way to create spans which can be supplied with a language attribute. The introduction of spans in wiki syntax would also provide powerful formatting possibilities without having to resort to HTML-like syntax like some plugins do. \nHere is how spans in german and english would look like:\n%[de-DE]Ein Paragraph in Deutsch%\n%[en-EN]A paragraph in english%\nYou can try the full textile notation at http://textism.com/tools/textile/index.php \n\nAnother approach would be to specify a language for the whole page. In practise this would be very impractical because often only parts of the page need to be translated, for example a summary. Other content like a spare parts list and the page structure are language neutral. ",

The email-hash-to-username mapping is also regenerated for every user at startup and whenever a user is added or removed. It may work fine in instances with a few hundred users, but will probably quickly grind your Confluence instance to a halt after that. The lack of concurrency protection on the mapping HashMap is also a grave concern, given it is potentially read and updated quite frequently.\r\n\r\nI think it would be best if this functionality was implemented in the applications.

Particular edge cases I remember us identifying and fixing in the user hover:\n\n* positioning: when it appears near the screen edge, it should float _across_ instead of down\n* size: it should _expand_ to fit long status messages\n* menu: it should have a drop-down menu properly positioned at the bottom, including popping the menu _upwards_ when the hover appears near the bottom of the screen\n* timing: the appearance of the user hover is done with a timer which starts only when the mouse stops moving. This mimics the tooltip behaviour in browsers.\n* clickable buttons: the follow/stop-following links are toggles that when clicked _do not_ close the user hover.\n",

This will allow easier copying of the spaces.\n\nUse case:\nWe are using Confluence for documenting our software - each version has it own space. Space for the newer versions are being copied from the existing spaces, e.g. space for version 3.1 is created as a copy of space for version 3.0. Unfortunately absolute links like SPACE30:PageA will remain untouched and so user is navigated to the older version of space.\nIt would help a lot should the \"linking dialog\" distinguish between linking pages within the same space and creating link to the other space...",
