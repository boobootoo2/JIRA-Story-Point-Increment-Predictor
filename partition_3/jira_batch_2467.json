Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create a team in Bitbucket -- the team will be by default on free 5 user plan\r\n# Create two private repos in the team, repoA and repoB\r\n# Add 3 users to one of your team's User Groups (including yourself, that will be 4 users in total)\r\n# Afterwards, add a 5th user directly to repoA, from this repo's {{Settings >> Access Management}}\r\n# Then, go to repoB, and open its {{Overview}} page\r\n# At the top right corner of the page, there will be a link to Send Invitation to users: !3546174972-Screen%20Shot%202016-09-22%20at%2018.58.39.png|thumbnail!\r\n# Select that, and in the popup that opens, select the tab {{Repository}}\r\n# Add the 5th user's _email_ (not his username) and then send the invite\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe 5th user is able to accept the invitation.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nWhen the 5th user tries to accept the invitation for repoB, he sees this message:\r\n!2377382428-Screen%20Shot%202016-09-22%20at%2016.14.23.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nh3.
