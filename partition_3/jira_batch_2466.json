The only way to display \"comments\" inside the logs is by using e.g an echo command, like {{echo Do stuff with the repo we need}}.\n\nIt would be handy to have some way to document what is being done inside the log, e.g by printing commented commands.

      "description": "Hello,\n\nSSH multiplexing with bitbucket was disabled and causes many problems - especially in case you use multiple repositories at once (this is for example problem when you do android AOSP development and use repo and gerrit - both of them are often performing operations on many repos at the same time. For repo, it is not a big problem - just a warning message. For gerrit, it is a huge problem as replication fails permanently when SSH multiplexing cannot be established. There are some nasty workarounds in place,\n\nThe change happened in July and it is plaguing us till today (we are using some workarounds after we found the reason but It would be much better if it is solved by enabling mulitplexing back - because the workarounds put unnecessary pressure on your infrastructure - for example now we have a job that mirrors about 100 repositories to bitbucket every 10 minutes and that would not be necessary at all if ssh multiplexing is working.\n\nMore details can be found in https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/39449158/answers/43549761/comments/43550008\n\nAnd I was redirected from https://support.atlassian.com/servicedesk/customer/portal/11/BBS-42335 to create the issue.\n\nLet me copy some parts of this that are relevant:\n\n\"Up until a couple of days ago (I guess before the LFS beta was available), I was able to repo sync my android tree with bitbucket, and had no issues replicating with gerrit to bitbucket. Ever since that change, I get this error when repo syncing:\\\\\nchannel 2: open failed: administratively prohibited: cannot open additional channels\\\\\nmux_client_request_session: session request failed: Session open refused by peer\\\\\nAnd something very similar with gerrit replication. I tried temporarily switching my repos to another git server provider, and as I expected everything is ok. Any info on this? Thanks.\"\n\nAug 12:\\\\\n\"I struggled with this for a while but had no time to take a closer look. Now I know what happens and I have a workaround.\\\\\nThe problem is that Bitbucket disabled capability of multiplexing for SSH connections. In short: multiplexing works in the way that you only connect to the same server once. All the other connections are executed as additional channels opened via the single master connection already opened. Git automatically runs ssh commands in multiplexing mode under the hood. You can see that if you run the following while repo sync is running:\\\\\nps -eaf | grep ssh\\\\\nYou will see something similar to:\n\n{code}\n#!text\n\nssh -o ControlMaster=no -o ControlPath=some_path_here .....\n{code}\n\nUnfortunately you cannot use .ssh/config (because -o parameters override it).\\\\\nUPDATE: See below answer - apparently you can have ControlMaster set to yes in .ssh and it works fine\\\\\nThe solution that I found was to change default SSH command that GIT uses and disable multiplexing altogether. You can set GIT_SSH_COMMAND as follows:\n\n{code}\n#!text\n\nexport GIT_SSH_COMMAND=\"ssh -o ControlPath=none\"\n\n{code}\n\nOnce you do it - git will use your ssh command instead of the default and it will open new SSH connection for every git command separately. It&#x27;s a bit slower than when multiplexing works but when Bitbucket rejects multiplexed channels, repo sync is even slower (by default ssh will fall-back to non-multiplexing connection when the multiplexing fails so it still works despite the error messages - but much slower).\\\\\nAdd it to your .bashrc or similar and you should be good to go.\\\\\nOne drawback of this solution is that it is a global setting - all your git via ssh will stop using multiplexing. \"\n\nOct 19:\\\\\nUpdate: It seems also that works (and it localised to Bitbucket only - so it&#x27;s better solution):\\\\\nIn your .ssh/config add ControlMaster yes for bitbucket:\\\\\nHost bitbucket.org\\\\\nControlMaster yes\\\\\nMichael Bayer -> we also had problem with replication. Some repos from Gerrit failed to replicate to Bitbucket (especially when there were branches or deleted changes). I know it&#x27;s a lame solution but we solved it in a simple way. Additionally to built-in Gerrit replication we also run a crontab job every 10 minutes to mirror our repos to Bitbucket - so most of the changes are replicated almost immediately by Gerrit, but those that fail are later re-synced using the external mirroring...\\\\\nHere is the script that we use:\n\n{code}\n#!bash\n\n#!/bin/bash\ndate\npushd /mnt/gerrit/git\nSKIPPED_REPOS=\"(All-Projects.git|All-Users.git)\"\nfor repo in *\ndo\necho\nif [[ $repo =~ ^$SKIPPED_REPOS$ ]]; then\necho \"Skipping mirroring $repo\"\ncontinue\nfi\nif [ ! -d \"$repo\" ]; then\necho \"Skipping non-directory $repo\"\ncontinue\nfi\npushd $repo >/dev/null\nREPO_URL=git@bitbucket.org:someprefix/$repo\necho \"Mirroring $repo to $REPO_URL\"\ngit push --mirror $REPO_URL 2>&1\npopd >/dev/null\ndone\npopd\ndate\n\n{code}\n\nIt mirrors a bit more than the default gerrit replication (includes gerrit config as well for the repo) - but it&#x27;s still OK.\\\\\nIt also increases traffic for Bitbucket quite significantly. I wonder if the latest SSH outages are connected to the fact that some people like us are generating lot more traffic for Atlassian than is needed because we are workarounding some not-well-thought changes on their side.\\\\\nHey Atlassian !!! - Hear us out please. Enable the SSH mulitplexing back. It will save you ton of traffic and infrastructure to handle it.",

It allows reviewers to look file-by-file at each change and make comments so the PR author can fix them.\n\nThe Bitbucket Cloud product already shows the Diff tab when a PR is created, but this is only useful to the PR author.  To be effective in team environments, contributors also need to be able to review and comment on changes on a file-by-file basis.\n\nI contacted Atlassian support and was told that at the end of each PR is a \"files changed\" section that shows the changes.  Reviewing pages and pages of inline diffs is cumbersome at best, and at worse it is simply broken (see attached photo).\n\nSince the Diff tab already exists for PR submission, it should be trivial to add it to the PR review screen. The utility of this functionality cannot be overstated.\n\nPlease enable this feature in Bitbucket Cloud.\n\nI&#x27;m filing this as blocking because Bitbucket Cloud implementation is actually broken for large PR&#x27;s.\n\n!3961702609-bitbucket_cloud_pr.png|thumbnail!",
