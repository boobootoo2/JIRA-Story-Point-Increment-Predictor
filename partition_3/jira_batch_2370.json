I understand that for some users it may more of a feature, but in an enterprise environment this is a potential key to intellectual property.  If you wish to accommodate your smaller users then perhaps make it an option in the administrative interface to turn on and off.  The fix (if not already fixed in newer releases) may be as simple as adding an autocomplete=off in the form tag.\r\n\r\nThe second issue is that secure pages can be cached by the browser.  Again, some customers may want this for some reason, but when intellectual property is at stake it is better to turn this off on the server side.  A potential method is to set the HTTP header with:\r\n\r\n'Pragma: No-cache' and 'Cache-control: No-cache'.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a side note there seems to be potential for CSRF, but without definitive results I am not officially reporting them.  If it turns out to be exploitable I'll create a new issue.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nJames\r\n",

As the issue hasn't collect votes, watchers, comments, or support cases from many customers during its lifetime, it's very low on our priority list, and will not be fixed in the foreseeable future. That's why we've decided to resolve it as *Timed Out*.\r\n\r\nAlthough we're aware the issue is still important to those of you who were involved in the conversations around it, we want to be clear in managing your expectations. The Bitbucket Server team is focusing on issues that have broad impact and high value, reflected by the number of comments, votes, support cases, and customers interested. Please consult the [Atlassian Bugfix Policy|https://confluence.atlassian.com/support/atlassian-bug-fixing-policy-201294573.html] for more details.\r\n\r\nWe understand how disappointing this decision may be, but we hope you'll appreciate our transparent approach and communication. If you're really passionate about this suggestion, please comment with your case in detail and we'll reconsider. Atlassian will continue to watch this issue for further updates, so please feel free to share your thoughts in the comments.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nImran Khan\r\nProduct Manager - Bitbucket Server and Data Center\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nOur style guides require lines to be less than 150 chars for java and 80 chars for all other languages and it would be nice to have a way of configuring stash to provide a line showing these length limits.\r\n\r\nMost review systems just have a vertical red line at the configured length limit and that would do fine for us, but highlighting characters that are longer than the limit would also work.",
