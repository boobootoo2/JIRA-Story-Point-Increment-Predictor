Due to this, it is possible to have a commit with a description pointing to an Issue Key which is present in more than one Jira instance. In this circumstance, the following logic can be observed - [Linking Bitbucket Server with JIRA|https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/linking-bitbucket-server-with-jira-776640408.html]\r\n\r\n{quote}If Bitbucket Server is linked with multiple JIRA Software instances and the projects happen to have the same key, only the issue from the instance marked as PRIMARY will be displayed.

Ultimately, there is no easy way for a user to specify, or identify, which Jira instance to link a commit to in the circumstance where there are multiple instances with the specified issue key.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nIn the Bitbucket UI, it would be valuable to present the user with an alert or other visual indicator indicating that the Jira issue key the commit is linked to is present in more than one Jira instance. \r\n\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\n\u00a0\r\nUsers may unexpectedly find commits linked in their Jira issues when those issues inadvertently share the same issue key as the intended issue from another instance.

Really, this should just point to a bookmark name ideally.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWhat we are looking for:\r\n\r\nBitbucket should be bookmark aware.

Your input in the comments helps us understand how this affects you and what you're hoping to accomplish with Bitbucket Server.\r\n\r\nWe spend a significant amount of time on an ongoing basis to determine our product investments in Bitbucket Server. Unfortunately, we are not currently planning to address this suggestion in near future. I understand that this may be disappointing, but we believe it\u2019s important for us to be open, honest and transparent with our customers. Product feedback is collected from a number of different sources and is evaluated when planning the product roadmap.

      "description": "We are *missing bugs* that reviewers reported in BitBucket Pull Requests -- due to a nuance of this tool. We like this tool! But please help us catch _all_ of the bugs we report.\r\nh3. PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:\r\n\r\nPull Requests (PR) are starting to feel too complicated to be thorough, when we have a lot of comments on multiple files and multiple commits. \u00a0We need a way to know we've addressed all comments, but the way Bitbucket displays them sometimes makes them hard to see. \u00a0For instance, during a Pull Request, our natural inclination is to review a file from top to bottom. The Overview page is listed in reverse chronological order of when comments were made, which would be inconvenient for a comprehensive code review with multiple files and reviewers. So instead of using the overview page, we go straight to the Diff page, and select the files to review in order, using \"Show Diff of 'All changes in this pull request'\".\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I just learned that that setting does NOT show all the review comments if there are multiple commits. If some comments are made in a BitBucket Pull Request, then the author uploads corrections for those comments, and then additional comments are made: not all the comments will be displayed. If we don't realize the problem (which has happened), we may never review all the comments. Our expectation was that I would see them all, so the interface was not intuitive enough to help us get it right. \u00a0We need to go through the Overview page to make sure all were covered. \u00a0But with a hundred comments, all colored the same, in order of comment creation -- it is tedious and error-prone to search.\r\nh3. POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS:\r\n\r\nAll the comments are on the Overview page, but that page is not in an efficient format for large reviews. If it had the ability to *change its sort order* to \"By File\" in addition to the default \"Reverse Chronological\", we could more easily find the missing information.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, maybe a checkbox on the Overview page could *enable comment display for each commit*, so they could be cycled through.\r\n\r\nAnother option would be to have a *Diff view that somehow marked how many unique comments exist on each commit*, similar to the red circle with a white number currently employed in the top-right of my screen, that indicates the number of unapproved Pull Requests I have that are outstanding.\r\n\r\nAnother option may be to *allow comments to be marked as read or resolved*, and then display a \"number of comments not read by reviewers\" count so we can make sure it is zero before approving a PR.\r\n\r\nAnother option would be to allow a *Diff View to accumulate changes and comments from multiple commits.* That sounds technically challenging, though it would be nice.\r\n\r\nAnother option may be to *carry forward comments with each new commit, until they are marked resolved.* That would be neat, but seems technically challenging.\r\n\r\nThank you for considering this problem.",

      "description": "Hi,\r\n\r\nWe've installed Bitbucket Data Center 5.2.2 at a client, mainly for the smart-mirroring option.\r\n\r\nWhat we would like to see is that we can mirror on a per repository level instead of a per project level. Our projects have repositories which belong logically together. Development takes place around the globe, but not all repositories in one project needs to be synced to the mirrors. In some cases in is not even allowed to sync them (export-rules/legislation). I understand that the current implementation was done for ease of administration. But it has a severe downside. Now we have to create several projects and place repositories in them which may be synced to one site but not to another. It is really hard now to keep track of it and I can't explain it to the developers.\r\n\r\nNext to the administration hassle and user experience we also have bandwidth problems. In some cases we have projects where a few very large repo's are present (>1GB). These do not have to be synced to a mirror, but others do. Now we have to sync all of them, which has a severe impact on the bandwidth we have and performance is drastically reduced.\u00a0\r\n\r\nSo please give the system administrators (or even better the project/repo administrators) the possibility to mirror individual repositories. Giving repository or project administrators the option to mirror their repository would also be inline with the paradigm shift I see in Jira (power to the project admins!)\r\n\r\nRudy Holtkamp\r\n\r\nThis issue has been created on suggestion of Tiago Vitorino (tvitorino@atlassian.com)",

This means that git will no longer write the objects in a push directly into the repository. Instead the objects are written to a temporary quarantine directory while the pre-receive hooks are executed. Once all hooks complete successfully the objects are copied to the repository.\r\n\r\nThe root cause of the issue is that in the context of a pre-receive hook a quarantine environment needs to be configured so that the git commands executed by Bitbucket Server will have access to the objects being pushed. Unfortunately this environment is always applied and it means that if a pre-receive hook attempts to access a different repository it will still read the objects from the push repository.\r\n\r\nWorkaround:\r\n\r\nHave the pre-receive hook move the logic to a separate thread, perhaps using the {{ExecutorService}}. The pre-receive hook can then wait on the {{Future#get}} call. This should prevent the quarantine environment from being applied to the command.",

In [Bitbucket Server home directory|https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/bitbucket-server-home-directory-776640890.html]\u00a0we advise against using UNC paths and instead mapping the network drive to a local drive letter or using {{mklink}} to create a symbolic link pointing to the UNC path. If you decide to link to your network storage using {{mklink}} and you use this storage as the Bitbucket Server home directory, Bitbucket Server incorrectly determines the size of the storage (total and available size) for the shared home (instead of detecting the size of the network storage it detects the size of the volume on which the symbolic link is placed).\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\n*\u00a0Bitbucket Server on Windows\r\n* Bitbucket home directory hosted on a shared network linked via mklink\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Install Bitbucket Server on Windows\r\n# Create an empty directory on any volume, say {{C:\\storage}} to be used as the Bitbucket home directory\r\n#\u00a0Open a command prompt and navigate to the directory created in step 2\r\n# Run the following command: {{mklink /d bitbuckethome \\\\server\\share}} (where {{bitbuckethome}} is the name of the link that will be created and {{\\\\server\\share}} is the UNC path to the shared storage location that will host the Bitbucket home directory\r\n# Update the {{%BITBUCKET_HOME%}} environment variable so it points to {{C:\\storage\\bitbuckethome}}\r\n# Start Bitbucket Server\r\n# Create a support zip\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nWhen looking at the {{application.xml}} contained in the support zip, the disk size information for the Bitbucket home directory and the Bitbucket shared home directory is the size information of the network drive.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThe disk size information for the Bitbucket home directory is the size information for the network drive, but the size information for the shared home is that of the local volume that contains the symbolic link, even though the shared home directory is a sub directory of the Bitbucket home, which is on the network location.\r\n\r\nAn example extract from the {{application.xml}} is below:\r\n{code:xml}\r\n<filesystem>\r\n    <home>\r\n      <path>C:\\storage\\bitbuckethome</path>\r\n      <name>STORAGE</name>\r\n      <description>STORAGE (\\\\server\\share$)</description>\r\n      <free-size>1000.00 GB</free-size>\r\n      <total-size>900.00 GB</total-size>\r\n      <type>NTFS</type>\r\n    </home>\r\n    <shared-home>\r\n      <path>C:\\storage\\bitbuckethome\\shared</path>\r\n      <name>STORAGE</name>\r\n      <description>STORAGE (C:)</description>\r\n      <free-size>19.90 GB</free-size>\r\n      <total-size>20.00 GB</total-size>\r\n      <type>NTFS</type>\r\n    </shared-home>\r\n  </filesystem>\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\n\r\nOther than using local storage rather than networked storage there is no known workaround.",
