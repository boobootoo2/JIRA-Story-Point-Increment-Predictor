We are using the search request view module (https://developer.atlassian.com/static/connect/docs/latest/modules/jira/search-request-view.html) to do some exports on issue navigator, and we have a real problem.\r\nThat component requires to configure a url where JIRA will call our addon when a user select our export option on issue navigator.\r\n\r\nThat call from JIRA to our addon sends a request object, with jwt info of authetication and user info of the user who click our export option. After that, we have the control on our addon code and we are doing some REST calling to JIRA API.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that, on this Rest calls from our addon to JIRA API, it seems that the user info is working well, because, although the user has configured Spanish language, the JIRA API call is returning me the information in perfect English language. We have done many Rest JIRA callings before and if the user has selected a different language on his profile from English, the info is returned in that language.\r\n\r\nI'm following that guide to do the Rest call to JIRA API (https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-connect-express#markdown-header-how-to-send-a-signed-outbound-http-request-back-to-the-host). For that, I have tested with this two options of making the Rest call:\r\n\r\n\r\n{code:java}\r\nFirst option:\r\n        addon.httpClient.get({\r\n                url: '/rest/api/2/search\r\n            },\r\n            function (err, httpResponse, body) {\r\n                    //myCode\r\n            }\r\n        );\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n\r\nSecond option:\r\n\r\n{code:java}\r\n        var httpClient = addon.httpClient({\r\n            clientKey: myClientKey,\r\n            userKey:  myUserKey,\r\n            appKey: myAppKey\r\n        });\r\n        httpClient.get({\r\n                url: '/rest/api/2/search\r\n            },\r\n            function (err, httpResponse, body) {\r\n                    //myCode\r\n            }\r\n        );\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nI need that the issue info returned by this Rest JIRA API call is localiced in the user language. When I say the user language, I mean the user that clicks on the export option, the one that is registered on the request object that is send from JIRA to out addon.\r\n\r\nRegards.",

      "description": "||Atlassian Update - 20 August 2019||\r\n|Hi everyone,\r\n Thank you for giving your feedback and time. After considering how our customers use our storage, we have decided to make the following changes to our Jira and Cloud offerings: \r\n * We have increased Standard storage for Jira and Confluence products from 25GB to 250GB.\r\n * We have an\u00a0*unlimited storage offering* for customers who purchase[ Premium\\|[https://www.atlassian.com/software/premium]] for either Jira or Confluence, on top of other benefits Premium customers will get.\r\n\r\nAs a result, I am marking this ticket as DONE. For more information, please check out our [Cloud storage policies\\|[https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/storage-for-jira-and-confluence-873871366.html]].\r\n Please let me know if you have any questions.\r\n Best regards,\r\n Jenny Chu\r\n *Product Manager, Atlassian Cloud*\\||\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u2014\r\n\r\nCurrently, the cloud disk space limit is 25 GB.\r\n\r\nIdeally, customers should have the ability to select the amount of disk space they require and, in future, be able to upgrade if needed. This should ideally be done via paid disk space tiers and not necessarily by user tier.\r\n\r\nA related ticket (CLOUD-7509) recommends increasing disk space by user tier. I expect there are 10 user licensed instances that could leverage 100GB+ and 2000 user licensed instances that will never exceed the existing 25GB limit. Offering disk space options outside of user tiers should incur a more efficient use of available storage and provide customers with payment options that provide a greater ROI to Atlassian based on storage efficiency alone.",

Both the functionality that is available to all customers with organizations and [domain verificationhttps://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/verify-a-domain-for-your-organization-873871234.html], and the functionality included with an Atlassian Access subscription, map to what is available for our on-premises products with Atlassian Crowd.\r\n\r\nThis includes:\r\n* Ability to view, deactivate, and delete accounts used across multiple products\r\n* A central view of all the applications you administer\r\n* Ability to set up single sign on (by connecting to a SAML-based identity provider)\r\n* Ability to set up user provisioning and deprovisioning\r\n* Ability to sync groups from AD or LDAP (via a cloud identity provider)\r\n* A consolidated audit log of user and group changes across your company\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nDave Meyer\r\nPrincipal Product Manager, Atlassian Access\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nI manage an extranet for partners.  Currently, Confluence OnDemand's Admin console is pretty sparse on user management features.  I need the ability to require users to reset their passwords periodically (or be disabled), identify and disable stale user accounts, generate and export lists of users, etc.\r\n\r\nThe biggest concern I have is that users leave their current companies and go to one of my competitors.  Unless someone else in that company tells me that user is no longer with them, I have no way of knowing.  This exposes my company's confidential information to a potential competitor.\r\n\r\nI would be interested in purchasing a Crowd OnDemand subscription.  This issue is not requesting standalone Crowd integration with OnDemand products, though I can imagine users being interested in that.",

I'm hoping someone has previously investigated this and come up with alternatives - I've googled answers for this problem but none that fit what I need.\r\n\r\nHappy to talk through the process with a JIRA expert if available.\r\n\r\nRegards\r\nJP Cameron",

Right now I have to use the Maven Cloud Foundry plugin which makes me have to download my repo during deployment time and stick artifacts into their original directories so I can call the Maven plugin goals to push.\r\n\r\nThe other option is to use Cloudbees but I would prefer to stay on Atlassian Cloud because of its integration with Jira.",
