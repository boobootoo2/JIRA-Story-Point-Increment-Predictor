Summary\r\n\r\nIn case that Bitbucket Server is integrated with external directories, remember-me token should be ignored when the requiresPasswordChange attribute is set to true in the Crowd directory.\r\nThe root need is that users can still log in after an administrator forces a password change (due to the remember-me token).\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\n * Bitbucket Server 4.9.0\r\n * Crowd 2.9.1\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Integrate Bitbucket Server with Crowd\r\n # Log in Bitbucket Server with a user (User A) and then, check \"Remember my login on this computer\"\r\n # Restart the browser\r\n # Access Bitbucket Server with the same browser\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nBitbucket Server should show login page and need User A to input the credentials\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nUser A could log in without any authentication.\r\nh3. Notes\r\n * The above actual results might cause some troubles in the following scenario{panel}_In case that there are some password leakages, an admin of the external directories wants the users to update their passwords immediately._\r\n # In the past, User A logged in Bitbucket Server with checking \"Remember my login on this computer\"\r\n # An admin of Crowd notices that a password of User A was leakked\r\n # The admin access Crowd, open user setting page of User A and set an attribute called \"requiresPasswordChange\" as \"true\" (It would require User A to update the password when the next login.)\r\n # In spite of the above setting, User A can login Bitbucket Server without updating the password{panel}\r\n* JIRA, Confluence and Bamboo behave as well at this moment\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nDisabling remember-me token is only the workaround.",

Only until you reach the very end of the list, you are then able to click it. If you have a lot of projects, then this can take some time to reach. A viable solution to this would be to have the button at the top of the list instead, so there's no need to even scroll to reach it.\r\n\r\nFinally, if you have accidentally clicked on a project name whilst searching, you have to start all the way back from the beginning of the list.

When we come back to check the changes they made, we normally can't remember what changes we asked for exactly. This is a large scale application and with so many developers. \r\n\r\nSo if the file we commented is changed, we no longer can see the comment or the task unless you go to 'Activity' tab which only shows you the outdated code. We need to have 2 window side by side one with outdated code and the other with the new code to compare.\r\n\r\nI wish we could see what file we made the comment and or created task against in the top where the changed files are listed as part of that PR. \r\n\r\nThen by just clicking the button in front of the file, that we created task for, we could see both outdated one from the activity and the new one side-by-side. \r\n\r\nThe current side-by-side difference only shows the difference with the target branch to be merged in not with the previous commit\r\n\r\nI know it is very hard to find what line of code we made comment against to display that as the new commit may have radically changed the file but displaying the whole file including the comment/task we created is possible.

Active directory already has a policy of locking the account after X attempts, so bitbucket server does not need CAPTCHA to protect against brute force attacks for these users.\r\n # Users built inside bitbucket server's internal directory (such as Atlassian's recommendation that you always keep an administrator or sysadmin account active in the Bitbucket Server internal directory) You would like CAPTCHA to protect these accounts.\r\n\r\nFor users in group #1, the CAPTCHA is a huge annoyance. If they get locked out of AD, there is now a two step process\r\n # Unlock AD account\r\n # Fill out bitbucket server CAPTCHA\r\n\r\nThis approach really doesn't scale if every Atlassian tool uses it. A locked password could potentially require you to\r\n # Unlock in AD\r\n # CAPTCHA for bitbucket server\r\n # CAPTCHA for bamboo\r\n # CAPTCHA for jira\r\n # ... (at some point you lose the point of having a centralized ID unlock mechanism)\r\n\r\nAt this point you would be tempted to turn off\u00a0CAPTCHA entirely, but it's a bad idea because people could then brute force the accounts built in the internal directory.\r\n\r\nThe ideal solution seems to be the ability to turn off CAPTCHA only for users that are managed by an external user directory - is that possible?",

The reason for that is because the branch may have been updated on the source repository, and by reopening it the *usera* would be essentially giving himself access to new changes he doesn't have permission to see.\r\n\r\nh3.Actual Results\r\n* *usera* receives the following message:\r\n!usernotpermitted.png|thumbnail!\r\n* The below exception is thrown in the atlassian-bitbucket.log

As a result, this issue only affects Stash 3.x and does not affect any version of Bitbucket Server.\r\n\r\nAs Stash 3.11 is well past its support window for bugs that are not security related, the fix for this issue will not be backported. Administrators which encounter this issue should upgrade to Bitbucket Server, which includes the fix. Workarounds for Stash 3.x administrators are:\r\n* Disable \"Transcode diffs\", to prevent leaked descriptors\r\n* Increase the maximum open files for the Stash {{java}} process and periodically restart it to clear leaked handles",

This means that I'll have to open other pull request targeting master, and all comments in the original PR will be lost.\r\n\r\nOther possible solution would be to NOT automatically decline the PR.

      "description": "h3. Summary\r\n\r\nIn Bitbucket Data Center instances, the bundled {{bitbucket-tag}} plugin\u00a0re-indexes tags in repositories on all cluster nodes after every repository change. In extreme cases where repository changes are very frequent and/or tag re-indexing is very slow,\u00a0this work\u00a0can\u00a0delay other, higher priority, work that runs on the same threads, such as cluster-wide invalidations of Hibernate and Atlassian-cache caches.\u00a0 This can lead to caches becoming inconsistent on different cluster nodes for an extended period of time.\r\n\r\nh3. Symptoms\r\n\r\nIf affected, certain state (such as the set of comments visible on a pull request) may be inconsistent when viewed on different cluster nodes. The inconsistency may last for several minutes or (in extreme cases) even longer, before eventually fixing itself without further action.\r\n\r\nWhile affected, monitoring of the {{com.hazelcast:name=HazelcastInstance.EventService}} statistics over JMX (as described in [this page|https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/enabling-jmx-counters-for-performance-monitoring-776640189.html]) will show the {{eventQueueSize}} value, which should normally be close to 0, grow to very large values for an extended period of time. Alternatively, enabling the following properties\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\nhazelcast.health.monitoring.level=NOISY\r\nhazelcast.health.monitoring.delay=300\r\nlogging.logger.com.hazelcast.util.HealthMonitor=TRACE\r\nlogging.logger.com.hazelcast.internal.monitors.HealthMonitor=INFO\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nand restarting the instance will continuously log lines to {{atlassian-bitbucket.log}} of the form:\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\n2016-08-04 11:58:14,956 INFO  [hz.hazelcast.HealthMonitor]  c.h.internal.monitors.HealthMonitor ... event.q.size=...\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nWhile affected, the {{event.q.size}} value in this line will grow to very large values for an extended period of time.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nLog in as a system administrator, go to *Administration* >> *Manage add-ons*, and select the System add-ons. Find the \"Bitbucket Server - Tag\" plugin, and disable it. *Note*: The display of tags in the commit list (as described under \"Quickly see work done by using tags\" in [this page|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BitbucketServer/Stash+3.5+release+notes]) will be impaired while this workaround is in effect.\r\nh3.
