Atlassian Connect 1.0 [was released in March 2014|http://blogs.atlassian.com/2014/03/introducing-atlassian-connect-1-0/], and you can already get access to [more than 50 public add-ons today built using the platform|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/search?application=&category=&cost=&hosting=cloud&marketingLabel=].\r\n \r\nDue to stability and scalability reasons, we will not bundle additional third party add-ons with our Cloud offerings. But you should feel free to contact the vendors of your favourite add-ons to let them know that you would like them to create a Cloud version of the add-on! We will do our best to work together with the vendor to satisfy this request.\r\n \r\nSince we have no plans to bundle additional add-ons in Cloud, we are closing this issue.\r\n \r\nCheers,\r\nBartek\r\nJIRA Product Management\r\nbartek (at) atlassian (dot) com\r\n{panel}\r\n \r\n \r\n*Original request description:*\r\nIt would be a great feature to have the \"The Scheduler\" plugin available for ondemand:\r\n\r\nhttps://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/pl.com.tt.jira.plugin.theschedulerpro",

Atlassian Connect 1.0 [was released in March 2014|http://blogs.atlassian.com/2014/03/introducing-atlassian-connect-1-0/], and you can already get access to [more than 50 public add-ons today built using the platform|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/search?application=&category=&cost=&hosting=cloud&marketingLabel=].\r\n \r\nDue to stability and scalability reasons, we will not bundle additional third party add-ons with our Cloud offerings. But you should feel free to contact the vendors of your favourite add-ons to let them know that you would like them to create a Cloud version of the add-on! We will do our best to work together with the vendor to satisfy this request.\r\n \r\nSince we have no plans to bundle additional add-ons in Cloud, we are closing this issue.\r\n \r\nCheers,\r\nBartek\r\nJIRA Product Management\r\nbartek (at) atlassian (dot) com\r\n{panel}\r\n \r\n \r\n*Original request description:*\r\nPlease allow the [Create On Transition for JIRA|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/org.swift.jira.cot] plugin on OnDemand platform.\r\n\r\nIt would be a great feature.\r\n",

      "description": "Reference Confluence OnDemand\r\nsite. contentserv.atlassian.net\r\nHi,\r\n\r\nfor business reason, we would like to offer a multiple user account for access to our Knowledge Base. It would be good if we could restrict access to the \"Profile\" for a user (in the Download version I believe one can!) and remove the rights to \"People and Space Directory\", again business results.\r\n \r\nAs Atlassian is not offering these restriction features in the OnDemand (please confirm!!), we have decided to use the anonymous access. This does not fit our business needs, but it appears that we have no other choice.\r\n \r\nThat having been said, this \"anonymous\" access does not appear to hide Confluence \"Space\" Administrator or Content creator names. The Space \"Administrators\" name is shown in the \"Space Details\" GUI and the anonymous user has access to \"Extras\", which includes the pages history. On the page history GUI, the content creator names are displayed. In both cases, an anonymous person has access to privilege information and can use it for abuse.\r\n \r\nAlso, an anonymous user appears to be able to create a \"Blog\", which does NOT make sense as the user is anonymous. These system settings appears to be encouraging trouble and abuse.\r\n \r\nAn anonymous user should not have rights to access user names nor create Blog content!!! \r\n\r\nCan you help us here? This is important as we may have to drop Confluence as our Knowledge Base source!\r\n \r\nplease let us know,\r\n \r\ngerry\r\n",

Atlassian Connect 1.0 [was released in March 2014|http://blogs.atlassian.com/2014/03/introducing-atlassian-connect-1-0/], and you can already get access to [more than 50 public add-ons today built using the platform|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/search?application=&category=&cost=&hosting=cloud&marketingLabel=].\r\n \r\nDue to stability and scalability reasons, we will not bundle additional third party add-ons with our Cloud offerings. But you should feel free to contact the vendors of your favourite add-ons to let them know that you would like them to create a Cloud version of the add-on! We will do our best to work together with the vendor to satisfy this request.\r\n \r\nSince we have no plans to bundle additional add-ons in Cloud, we are closing this issue.\r\n \r\nCheers,\r\nBartek\r\nJIRA Product Management\r\nbartek (at) atlassian (dot) com\r\n{panel}\r\n \r\n \r\n*Original request description:*\r\nPlugin: https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.almworks.jira.plugin.jiraclient\r\n\r\nThe plugin is very simple - it only provides the site-wide licensing capacity for the JIRA Client application. Source code is available upon request.\r\n\r\nWe have a number of customers who use JIRA Client with JIRA OnDemand. They typically have to get a team license from ALM Works, but purchasing a site license from Atlassian would be beneficial.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this would also allow 10-user customers to use JIRA Client for $10, which is not possible right now.",

Atlassian Connect 1.0 [was released in March 2014|http://blogs.atlassian.com/2014/03/introducing-atlassian-connect-1-0/], and you can already get access to [more than 50 public add-ons today built using the platform|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/search?application=&category=&cost=&hosting=cloud&marketingLabel=].\r\n \r\nDue to stability and scalability reasons, we will not bundle additional third party add-ons with our Cloud offerings. But you should feel free to contact the vendors of your favourite add-ons to let them know that you would like them to create a Cloud version of the add-on! We will do our best to work together with the vendor to satisfy this request.\r\n \r\nSince we have no plans to bundle additional add-ons in Cloud, we are closing this issue.\r\n \r\nCheers,\r\nBartek\r\nJIRA Product Management\r\nbartek (at) atlassian (dot) com\r\n{panel}\r\n \r\n \r\n*Original request description:*\r\nThis is a request to bundle [Enterprise Message Handler (JEMH) for JIRA|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.javahollic.jira.jemh-ui] plugin for JIRA OnDemand.",
