In one hit that would provide the URL, make build status more promient, and auto-update for any subsequent builds.\n\n*What would still help*: it would help even to just have an option to make Pipelines more prominent in some projects, ideally including the build number. It would also be cool to have an option to delay PR notifications until a successful build has run. (ie. The same panel that&#x27;s on the project&#x27;s homepage, but scoped to the PR&#x27;s branch)",

What we really need is for bitbucket to track the bookmark.\n\nIssue BCLOUD-2.\n\nWe created a command line to create a Bitbucket PR based on the users active bookmark.\n\nHowever, bitbucket&#x27;s API isn&#x27;t \"bookmark aware\", which leads us to do something like:\n\nbody = {\\\\\n&#x27;title&#x27;: title,\\\\\n&#x27;close_source_branch&#x27;: False,\\\\\n&#x27;state&#x27;: &#x27;OPEN&#x27;,\\\\\n&#x27;summary&#x27;: {\\\\\n&#x27;raw&#x27;: description,\\\\\n},\\\\\n&#x27;source&#x27;: {\\\\\n&#x27;branch&#x27;: {&#x27;name&#x27;: &#x27;development&#x27;},\\\\\n&#x27;commit&#x27;: {&#x27;hash&#x27;: get_bm_hash(bookmark)}\\\\\n},\\\\\n&#x27;destination&#x27;: {\\\\\n&#x27;branch&#x27;: {&#x27;name&#x27;: destination}\\\\\n}\\\\\n}\n\nNote the {{\"get_bm_hash\"}} function.

      "description": "I&#x27;ve been experimenting with using Bitbucket Pipelines as a build step before deploying to Elastic Beanstalk applications and have greatly enjoyed the experience.\n\nHowever I am running into an issue when running {{eb deploy}}.\n\nWhen running {{eb deploy}} my application source is zipped up and uploaded to Elastic Beanstalk for deployment. After this task, the EB CLI then waits for the application to finish updating before exiting the current command. This can waste upwards of 3-4 build minutes on my account.\n\nI&#x27;m not sure if this would be on your side, or if I should make a request to AWS to add an improvement to their CLI.\n\nThank you for your help",
