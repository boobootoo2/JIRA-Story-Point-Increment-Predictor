      "description": "There are a few problems with the permissions setup right now:\r\n\r\nI. The documentation on Project vs. Repo permissions is poor.  I understand that you guys want to keep this simple, but this doesn't give me enough information to predict what combinations of Project (P) and Repo (R) permissions will do:\r\n\r\nhttps://confluence.atlassian.com/display/STASH/Using+repository+permissions\r\n\r\nIn particular there's nothing about whether repo permissions override project permissions or vice versa.  This should be made VERY clear in the docs.  The only place I see it listed is in the one sentence at the top of the repo permissions screen, but some example in the docs would be really useful.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. It appears that you can only expand permissions using repo-level permissions, but the UI is misleading.  Here are two similar situations:\r\n\r\nA. Expanding permissions:\r\n1. Add a user to the project and give him read permission (call this P+r-w)\r\n2. Add a user to a repo in that project and give him write permission (R+r+w)\r\nResult: User can push changes into the repo.\r\n\r\nB. Restricting permissions:\r\n1. Add a user to a project with write permission (P+r+w)\r\n2. Add a user to a repo within that project with read-only permission (R+r-w)\r\nResult: User can STILL push changes into the repo.\r\n\r\nA makes a lot of sense to me, but B does not.  For B, the result is unintuitive because the UI shows an explicitly UNCHECKED \"write\" box for that user on the repo.  But he can still write.\r\n\r\nI see two things you can do to fix this:\r\n1. Disallow (B) by not allowing write to be unchecked when a user already has project-level write permissions.\r\n2. Allow (B) and make the explicit repo-level permission take precedence over the project level permission.\r\n\r\nPersonally I prefer 2, because it gives the repo admin more power to restrict access to certain members of a project team.  You can also take it further and allow repo admins to uncheck *read* without deleting the permission for a particular user, and this would allow you to restrict writing too.\r\n\r\nFurther suggestions:\r\nIn general, having both project and repo permissions is confusing because I have to look at two screens to understand what is going on.  But, it's also very useful to be able to set defaults.\r\n\r\nYou could solve this very easily by making implicit project permissions show up automatically on the repo permission list.  Perhaps they could be faded to indicate that these permissions are inherited, and they wouldn't have an 'x' button to remove them.\r\n\r\nIf the UI did this, I could look at the repo screen and see *exactly* who has access to the repo and who does not.  Also, a repo admin could very easily check and uncheck boxes on the repo screen, expanding or restricting project permissions as he/she chooses.\r\n\r\nThis is more powerful than what the current UI allows, and I think it's more intuitive.  There is one simple rule to remember: look at the repo screen to see who can access your repo.\r\n\r\nOne final corner case: if a project permission is deleted, then the corresponding repo permission should go away if it still corresponds to the default.  If the repo admin has restricted or expanded it, the explicit change should stay on the repo to reflect the repo admin's intent.\r\n\r\nThoughts?",

As the issue hasn't collect votes, watchers, comments, or support cases from many customers during its lifetime, it's very low on our priority list, and will not be fixed in the foreseeable future. That's why we've decided to resolve it as *Timed Out*.\r\n\r\nAlthough we're aware the issue is still important to those of you who were involved in the conversations around it, we want to be clear in managing your expectations. The Bitbucket Server team is focusing on issues that have broad impact and high value, reflected by the number of comments, votes, support cases, and customers interested. Please consult the [Atlassian Bugfix Policy|https://confluence.atlassian.com/support/atlassian-bug-fixing-policy-201294573.html] for more details.\r\n\r\nWe understand how disappointing this decision may be, but we hope you'll appreciate our transparent approach and communication. If you're really passionate about this suggestion, please comment with your case in detail and we'll reconsider. Atlassian will continue to watch this issue for further updates, so please feel free to share your thoughts in the comments.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nImran Khan\r\nProduct Manager - Bitbucket Server and Data Center\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nShouldn't the *projects* get request return personal projects that the user is authorized to? There is the *isPersonal* property for distinguishing between personal and non-personal projects. Or can there be an option to request whether personal projects should be included or not?",

The {{ClassLoader}} internals were significantly retooled for Java 7, greatly reducing this contention. _It is highly recommended to run Stash on a Java 7 JVM._\r\n\r\nThe tops of affected call stacks look like this:\r\n{noformat}\r\n\"http-bio-7990-exec-10236\" daemon prio=10 tid=0x56c75400 nid=0x48df waiting for monitor entry [0x3c3e0000]\r\n   java.lang.Thread.State: BLOCKED (on object monitor)\r\n  at org.apache.catalina.loader.WebappClassLoader.loadClass(WebappClassLoader.java:1593)\r\n  - waiting to lock <0x74203f70> (a org.apache.catalina.loader.WebappClassLoader)\r\n  at org.apache.catalina.loader.WebappClassLoader.loadClass(WebappClassLoader.java:1559)\r\n  at java.util.ResourceBundle$Control.newBundle(ResourceBundle.java:2289)\r\n  at java.util.ResourceBundle.loadBundle(ResourceBundle.java:1364)\r\n  at java.util.ResourceBundle.findBundle(ResourceBundle.java:1328)\r\n  at java.util.ResourceBundle.findBundle(ResourceBundle.java:1282)\r\n  at java.util.ResourceBundle.findBundle(ResourceBundle.java:1282)\r\n  at java.util.ResourceBundle.getBundleImpl(ResourceBundle.java:1224)\r\n  at java.util.ResourceBundle.getBundle(ResourceBundle.java:952)\r\n  at com.atlassian.stash.internal.i18n.I18nServiceImpl.getBundle(I18nServiceImpl.java:197)\r\n  at com.atlassian.stash.internal.i18n.I18nServiceImpl.getText(I18nServiceImpl.java:102)\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nThe {{WebappClassLoader}} is a primary hotspot, since it's the parent {{ClassLoader}} for Stash itself. A {{jstack}} dump on a server with this issue showed 108 different {{http-bio}} threads waiting for the lock on that {{ClassLoader}}.\r\n\r\nSystems which are under heavy polling load (CI servers checking for changes, FishEye indexing, etc) are particularly susceptible to this, depending on the polling interval. Due to how {{git fetch}}/{{git clone}} handle authantication handshaking, each one produces a series of 3-4 HTTP requests. Each of those, in turn, result in many {{ResourceBundle}}-provided messages being loaded. If the load becomes heavy, the lock contention can push out request times to a point where the next wave of polling requests cascade onto the first, further increasing contention. The system is not _deadlocked_; requests _do_ still drain, but too slowly. The rising load eventually triggers some further form of failure, like an {{OutOfMemoryError}} due to the resources being held open in so many starving threads.",

I know that Stash has long had the ability turn on a web section inspector by appending a few query params on the url... awesome work, thanks for that. However, what if as a developer, you could define a web section simply by adding a special set of css classes to an html tag? The plugin dev would simply just use that css class when defining their web-item, panel, or fragment in the atlassian-plugin.xml. Also, as a plugin dev it would be super trivial to figure out the sections I could plug into simply by looking at the html source and doing a search for these classes.\r\n\r\nWhen you render a page, a response filter would look for these special css classes and detect those as a plugin point then look for anything that would need to be plugged into it.\r\n\r\nI'm creating this feature request here instead of JIRA or Confluence because you guys are rockstars in turning features into reality. And I figured that if you guys can do it, the JIRA and Confluence guys will follow your lead. Also... [~tim@atlassian.com] told me to do it.\r\n\r\nPlease make this happen.",

Your input in the comments helps us understand how this affects you and what you're hoping to accomplish with Bitbucket Server.\r\n\r\nThis suggestion is currently under consideration by the Bitbucket development team. We've explored possible implementations, but have yet to work out the best way to fit repository creator permissions within the current permissions model, both logically and visually. Therefore, we're not able to provide a timeline for when this suggestion will be resolved. [Learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nNorman Ma\r\n\r\nProduct Manager - Bitbucket Server\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nIn the parent issue (STASH-2789), the user asked for a way to give global Project Creator users permission to create repositories in projects which they do not own. It was closed because it was said that this was the intended behavior.\r\n\r\nHowever, our team would still benefit from being able to create new repositories inside projects that they do not own. Could we have a Repository Creator role per project so that certain users can create repositories in a project regardless of whether they were the creator?",
