Global colour scheme should be labelled as \"global colour scheme\" not \"custom colour scheme\".\n2. Global colour scheme should not say \"choose a colour scheme\" when there isn't a choice\n3. Global colour scheme should not use the label \"selected\" next to a colour scheme when there's no way to select any other.\n4. Space colour scheme should be clearer in showing what is the default (global) colour scheme, and what is the custom. A colour scheme can either be customised or it can be default, but the UI implies there are more options.\n\nIt looks like the interface of both space and global colour scheme pages was designed for a situation where there are more than 2 options to choose from. For colour schemes, there is only default or custom. The interface should reflect this better.\n\nSome other ideas:\n\n1. Make it easy to reset a single colour back to either the global default or the saved value. Put two colour boxes on the right of the colour picker in columns labelled 'Global default' and 'Current value', where clicking on them changes the text box value.\n2. Hide the unnecessary top row of colour boxes when editing a colour scheme.\n",

And many times it's seen that those attachments are not removed and they stay there forever; putting lots of work on bakup process. In order to prevent this problem; right now we have lowered the attachment size limit (2MB) and asked user to use file storage for any bigger attachments.\r\n\r\nI guess having inbuilt control on space quota (so that users can't add any new data till some unused get removed) will be good way to restrict/remove unwanted stuff lying there forever!\r\n\r\n-\r\n Rajendra\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n{panel:title=Atlassian Status as of June 2019|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#cccccc|titleBGColor=#dddddd|bgColor=#ffffff}\r\nHi everyone,\r\n\r\nThanks for participating in this issue, either by voting, commenting or just watching.

We use this channel often to learn the best we can with how customers use Confluence and how we can continue to improve the experience for as many users as possible.\r\n\r\nI'm happy to share that we are currently exploring better management solutions for attachments and plan to address this issue within the next 12 months.\r\n\r\nWe understand that resolving this problem is important for you, and we will keep monitoring usage and feedback on this issue.\u00a0We will keep you updated on the progress and timelines when the feature is going to be delivered.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n The Confluence Team\r\n{panel}\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

We have several users who have used other Wikis previously, and they have found this feature to be invaluable in being able to \"retrace\" their steps when moving through the Wiki.\n\nAlthough your \"History\" pop-up has some of this functionality, it does have some problems.  If you leave the pop-up window open, the history is not dynamically updated as you navigate through the pages: you must click on the \"History\" button to update the contents of the pop-up.  Also, if you click on a link in the History pop-up, then the pop-up closes, which is frustrating if you're trying to retain the history window as your main form of backward navigation.\n\nThe lack of this feature in the product may force us to look elsewhere for our Wiki selection (we are currently in the evaluation stage).",

They expect have the two tools integrated (/doc suburl is assigned to confluence).\nWhen you have both software it would also be nice to have links in the menu bar that link from Jira to Confluence and the other way round.\nI did modify the layout in Confluence to have a similar header but I had to revert to the standard layouts after upgrading to 2.2.2 for compatibility problem.

Some of them are already listed in CONF-4778. \nThe requests below \n\n- Support a (initial) size parameter for the image slidshow. This should also resize the popup accordingly.\n\nBackground: Mostly uploaded are images from digital cameras, 3 Megapixels and up. Those images do not fit on the screen, so you have to scroll the image left/right up/down which is annoying. Also, the images (e.g. 1-3 Megabytes) are transferred over the Network as a whole, where one could save traffic when the size was smaller. Unfortunately, the users are not that much trained so they could upload resized images (e.g. 800x600) -> The server must do the work.\n\n- Introduce a size combobox in the slideshow\n\nThe slideshow could have a combobox where the user selects the image size (e.g. 800x600, 1024x768, original size). Then, the image is scaled down by the server and transmitted. Saves network traffic and each user could select the size that fits on screen.\nOptionally, each tumbnail and the slideshow picture could get its own \"Save original picture as...\" link, so each user can download the original picture easily to get high-quality printouts.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nThanks for considering\nAndreas",

Administrators often need to be able to post content on behalf of their manager\n2. When bringing old content into Confluence it would be ideal to be able to maintain the original author without requiring that author to do the editing themselves\n\nThis relates to CONF-1711 which requires similar functionality for managing post dates. I guess what is really needed is a general metadata update privilege. Clearly this should not be a globally available privilege as it can be abused. I'd propose allowing administrators to be able to do this, and they should also to be able to grant permissions to others. It probably also needs to be a per-space setting.\n\n",

If no attachment is found on that page with those names, then check the parent page of page X for an attachment with the same name. (and it's parent, etc, to the Home page for the space).\n\nThat way, the higher in the heirarchy you attach a file, the more accessible it is in the space, and you don't have to duplicate the file, or use long specific page references (esp. for long page names), and even more important, if you move the child, it inherits a new set of attachments from it's new parent.  You can always override this behaviour by specifying a specific page !mypage^red.jpg!.\n\nalternative:\nIt might be sometimes useful to go the other way (access child attachments from a parent) but this is more difficult due to the many-to-one relationship, the much larger number of pages to search,  and the possibility of naming conflicts.  In this case, there might not be a good rule to follow. However, in the first case, each child only has one parent, and depths of the page trees tend to be somewhat limited (6 degrees of separation?), so it is clear which file to use and quick to check the parental heirachy axis.\n\nThanks,\nJames.",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-5913].\n  {panel}\n\nFor many pages, especially when using the many handy macros and plugins, the wiki markup quickly gets too complex for the beginner user. Nonetheless, these pages often contain blocks of less-complex content that I would like our more beginner users to be able to contribute to.  We can sometimes get around this by using 'includes' and directing our beginner users to the included sections.  However, systematically creating 'includes' for every text-block on a page quickly becomes unscalable, AND the attachments of the parent page are not so easily accessible to the included children.\n\nSuggestion:\n1. Create an 'edit this section' or just 'edit' button which appears in the greyed-out header sections of h1. h2. h3. etc headers.  Clicking on this 'edit' button would open up a  WYSIWYG/wiki/preview editor *for that section alone*. Once edited and saved, this section should then be merged seamlessly back into the page. In this manner, people editing separate sections have very little chance of causing a conflict, and people are discouraged from editing (and perhaps 'locking') the entire page if they are just updating a title or paragraph.\n2. allow the same sort of tag to be added to {column} tags, as an option. {column:edit=true} or the like.\n3. similar for tables, add an 'edit' button along the title line which would only edit that one table. In this case, a special 'table' editor view with quick-buttons to work with the table might be useful (add/delete row/column etc)\n4. defined blocks: {editable}this text will have an 'edit' button before or after it, and be editable as a block{editable} (or something like this\n5. editing  table cells (esp. for complex content) on their own might be useful.  For this, a right-click item of some sort would be required, as not to clutter the table with 'edit' buttons. Alternatively, suggestion 4 might mean this is not required.\n6. any other {div} / {span} or other sectional tags could have an optional {tag:edit=true} field that feeds thier content into the 'sub-section' editor.  In fact, you could probably overload this parameter for ALL block plugins (with the default, of course, being edit=false).\n\nThis enhancement would have the added benefit to alleviate some of the rednering complaints of the WYSIWYG editor that people are reporting as plugin macros are added and are not rendered in a way which is pretty for 'end-end-users'.  Instead, 'simple' users would be able to simply edit the blocks they understand and have been given the 'edit' button, while more advanced users might edit an entire section, or the entire page.\n\nmediawiki, as seen at wikipedia, does this quite well for paragraph headers.  My suggestions here abstract that to one step higher to include other types of sections.\n\nThis is related to some requests for new features where the users wants the preview / editor to 'jump' to the section being edited, but is perhaps a more elegant solution.\n\n",

Periodically a paniced email is sent to the Confluence mailing list asking how these files can be recovered. They can go through the backup/restore process but that is pretty painful and can take a while. It also doesn't help if a number of changes were made since the last backup.\n\nTo get around this we have instituted a policy of checking all such files into a separate source control system. Any files that need to be changed are checked out, modified and submitted to Confluence. Once they work the new version is checked back into source control. This process is tolerable, but it is a big overhead for such a simple feature.\n\nIt would be vastly preferable if Confluence treated these pieces of text as content just like pages, news etc. They could be versioned, you could see who edited them, you could see the diffs between versions etc. Since Confluence already has a powerful versioning system it seems like a no-brainer to use it for all the other pieces of content that are floating around.",
