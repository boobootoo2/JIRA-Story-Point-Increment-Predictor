The parent pages are just for organizational purposes, and do not contain any meaningful content beyond a page tree macro. Because new page creations do not have the option to turn notifications off, users will receive notifications when this structural page is created. The email is rather useless for our purposes, takes up resources, causes confusion, and \ncreates email bloat. I still want to reserve the ability to notify on child pages so turning all notifications off is not an option.

Most of them have got different groups and different users.\nWe'd like to provide our customer an easy view of which users have access to their spaces.\nUnfortunately our customers have no access to the space administration.\nAs we really like to give them the opportunity to see their space permissions, we'd like to user your userlister plugin.\nIs it possible for you to implement Bob Swifts macro security as described here (https://bobswift.atlassian.net/wiki/display/LIBSEC/Macro+Security+Library+for+Confluence) so only system administrators are allowed to use this plugin via security macro setting?\nBest wishes and thx for paying attention.\nChristopher Jaksch",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-30268].\n  {panel}\n\n*Context*\nWe have a large number (100 or so) of spaces that we create for our clients where we put information only relevant to them and not other clients. The information in these spaces are managed by a number of our client-facing teams, such as account managers and project managers.\n\nHowever, sometimes a new group (managed by LDAP) of users needs to be able to update information in all of these spaces and I currently have to run through each of these spaces manually, updating the permissions for each one. This is very time consuming.\n\n*Solution*\nAllow me to create schema that I can apply to multiple spaces so that updating the permissions on these spaces can be done centrally and once.\n\nNote that these schema should allow me to set additional permissions on a space. For example, all client spaces should have the \"clientspace\" schema applied to it but I should also be able to manually add that \"bobscountrybunker\" can view the \"Bob's Country Bunker\" space that has this schema applied to it.\n\nIt would also be beneficial for me to able to add multiple schema to a space.\n\n*Notes*\nYou could say that perhaps we should manage this through better group management (e.g., create a group that can specifically edit client spaces and then put all users in that group) but Confluence does not allow for nested groups in group management. In an organisation with hundreds of employees, I may end up spending an equal amount of time managing the users in the group rather than the individual space permissions.\n\nFurthermore, I'm sure you'll agree that this functionality would have a far greater positive impact than the specific use case I have provided.",

Some files of course are relevant to each group and we'd love to double expose the same file in both locations, perhaps using labels as the mechanism. \n\nUploaded files technically attach to a single location server-side, but seem to become attached to a single page within Confluence.

Why\n\nWhen editing a page, a crucial feature is to be able to view the diffs of the change *before* saving the change.  \n\nFor example:\n# I've updated a page with some small corrections.  (ex: north -> south and seperate -> separate).\n# I've also accidentally deleted a few sentences in a different section of the page without realizing it.\n# Being able to diff the changes would allow me to catch the unintentional changes before saving them\n\nh3. How\n\nConfluence allows viewing diffs of pages *after* they are saved (under Tools->Page History) The same diff functionality just needs to be re-used for providing a pre-save diff.\n\nh3. Additional Notes\n\n* Older versions of confluence (with wiki markup), MediaWiki/wikipedia, and most other top notch wiki solutions provide this functionality\n* MediaWiki calls this functionality \"Show Changes\"\n* This would also allow the possibility of avoid the multiple editor race condition:\n** Editor1 makes a change, but has not saved yet\n** Editor2 begins editing\n** Editor1 saves\n** Editor2 saves and *inadvertently rolls back Editor1's change*\n** If Editor2 had been able to preview the diff before saving, they could have seen Editor1's changes in there and avoided wiping them out.",

It would be great to be able to select several (i.e. via checkboxes) and then choose something like \"delete selected\". Also, a \"delete all\" button would be convenient in the attachments view.\n\nI attached a picture: As you can see, I attached 20 pictures (all at once via drag and drop in the \"Insert image\" manager). But I did that by accident, because I forgot I originally wanted to edit (cut) most of them first. So, now I want to delete them and have to manually delete every single file and then have to await the reload of the page.\n\nThanks in advance!",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-30161].\r\n{panel}\r\nh3. Problem Definition\r\n\r\nIf a user (e.g. a JIRA user) is not licensed to use Confluence, they cannot view any Confluence content (from JIRA or Service Desk for instance) - even if that content is available to anonymous users. They currently have to log out before they can see the content.\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nWe cannot allow authenticated but unlicensed users to edit anonymously accessible content, since that would mean that admins would only have to enable anonymous access to have the equivalent of an unlimited user license.\r\n Instead, we should allow authenticated but unlicensed users to get read-only access to confluence content with anonymous permissions.\r\n\r\nSuch users will still be locked out from parts of the application that require a licensed user, including viewing user profiles, people directories, etc, unless anonymous has been granted permission to view user profiles.\r\nh3. Solution for JIRA Service Desk customers\r\n\r\nLink JIRA Service Desk project to Confluence space to allow customers to have access to knowledge base in *Project Settings -> Knowledge Base*.\r\nThis does require the Jira Service Desk users to access these pages via the JSD portal knowledge-base otherwise images will not load due to permissions not being correct when checked against the media API. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n||Atlassian Status as of June 2019||\r\n|Thank you for your patience and being so vocal with regards to availability of this feature in Confluence Cloud.\u00a0We acknowledge that many of you are looking to share content with your customers and other external users without provisioning full licenses.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nI'm happy to share that we've put this suggestion on our roadmap and are planning to address it in the next 12 months.\r\n We will keep you updated on the progress and timelines when the feature is going to be delivered.\r\n Thanks again for your patience.\r\n \u00a0|\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
