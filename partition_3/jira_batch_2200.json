For example, all anonymous visitors looking for install assistance for Confluence will see results from the public test space and also many duplicates returned from archival spaces for older versions of Confluence. In particular, a page is often returned 3 times from the Confluence 2.7, 2,6 and 2.5 spaces. This is unprofessional for new users to see and generally makes search less useful. \n\nA solution is to add an administrative option where anonymous searches by default only search a manually selected list of spaces. This will allow technical writers to choose the latest documentation spaces and exclude rarely used public spaces, with the goal of making the default searches more accurate for anyone looking for product documentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

As when the request is coming through the LB, one does not know which specific node will be handling that request. Hence, if the request is delivered to a confluence node that has not been added to the trusted application list in JIRA, that particular user will not be allowed to see any information coming from JIRA (for example the {{jiraissue}} macro)\n\nTo improve this I would suggest to use +delegation approach+. When a trust is established with one node, as each node is aware of the others, a message should be displayed suggesting the other nodes IP addresses to be inserted into JIRA admin section. Alternatively, if possible, this information could be delegated and automatically inserted into the list of trusted applications in JIRA via some remote mechanism.\n",

Within a week of us rolling out Confluence at my company, people have started asking for it.  \n\nI am aware of the CONF-1210, CONF-7045, and CONF-6947 marked \"Will not fix,\" but this is a simple feature found in competing products which users find useful and I wanted to open it again and get votes behind it.\n\nThe {link-to} macro doesn't do this for external links so it doesn't satisfy this requirement.\n\n{panel:title=Atlassian Status as of September 19, 2016|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#3C78B5| titleBGColor=#3C78B5| bgColor=#E7F4FA} \nHi everyone, \n\nThank you for your ongoing feedback on this issue. On behalf of the Confluence team I would like to apologize for the changing status of this request. After many hours of discussion with design and product management, and after some engineering prototyping and testing, we have decided to close this issue as we do not plan to release this feature.\n\nWe aim to make our users' experience as friction-free as possible, and although being able to control the ways of opening links would be useful to many of you, it could easily lead to an inconsistent experience for users.\n\nIf your use of Confluence is in fact enhanced by opening particular links in a new window/tab then please consider using one of the existing solutions from our Marketplace (unfortunately they're not available for Cloud instances): \n\n* [ServiceRocket Linking Plugin|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/net.customware.confluence.plugin.linking]\n* [External Link Add-on|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/ch.bitvoodoo.confluence.plugins.externallinks]\n\nCheers,\n\nAdam Barnes\nConfluence Product Manager\n{panel}",

A look at the actual message (using Message->Source in Entourage menu) reveals that the message contains all of the right data. The same message on the IMAP server downloaded to alternate email clients (including MS Outlook on a PC, iPhone Mail, and Apple Mail) renders correctly.\n\nThere is however another user who has reported the same problem with MS Outlook, though this is not consistent with other users. At least two users using Microsoft Entourage at our site are receiving the 'blank' emails. Saving the message in its original format using Entourage again reveals that the contents of the message are there in the message.\n\nA hunch that this problem was an HTML display problem led me to edit the message and remove all of the stylesheet information (removing the {{<style>...</style>}} elements from the HTML inside the message. Sure enough, that edited email message displayed correctly in Entourage.  Also, switching to 'Text' format for notification emails allows the emails to be viewed, providing further evidence the problem is an HTML display issue only.\n\nSo it seems that the problem is with Microsoft Entourage (latest update to MS Office/Entourage 12.0.1 didn't fix the issue). However, the fact that it seems to occur on at least one instance of MS Outlook leads me to believe that perhaps something in the underlying stylesheet could be adjusted to work with Entourage and Outlook reliably.  If the stylesheet could be updated so that it renders properly in Entourage (probably some minor bug in Entourage/MS Office HTML rendering), this would be most desirable.\n\n",

Whilst Space Import can be done, this is done by an admin, the password for mail is pretty much useless to 'users', and need not be exposed, and is a security risk (others could POP and grab mail first, causing no end of confusion, which I would like to avoid).\n\nBest case would be to not export it at all in the XML output, or provide a dummy password (accepted, then, that the 'backup' would not result in an 'identical' restore)\n\nAn option to 'not' export password information would be great, as only a system admin would do the restore anyway.",

So instead of downloading a WAR file, you download a tar.gz file which you need to build yourself using a build.sh. I came across this when integrating confluence with crowd and I needed to open the war file myself and needed modify the contents of the war file.\n\nThe buildable distribution has the following advantages:\n\n- It is clear what you changed in contrast to the original by using the edit-webapp feature\n- You don't have to open and zip up the war file manually, which can be error phrone\n- different atlassian products have same distribution",

Unfortunately, there is no ordering to this!  They end up in a random jumbled order.\n\nMy suggestion would be to order them by name - this way, if you wanted to group things (e.g., animals-frog, animals-horse, animals-snake or flags-australia, flags-canada, flags-uk, flags-usa, et al) you could do it by name, and have a decent presentation ordering to the user.

Therefore, a user can upload a PNG, or a previous user who had a PNG can still link to it if it is present in the profile picture directory, but Confluence will NOT find PNGs in the directory and offer them to users to select.\n\nI think this is a bit short sighted.  IE6 is only one of several browsers.  PNG is a far superior format to GIF - converting PNG icons to GIF results in very dithered and pixelated images.  Also, the only IE6 issue was with PNG transparency... I think whatever is in the directory should be offered to the user - GIF, PNG, JPG, whatever - as long as it's a valid image and meets the size criteria.\n\nI had to convert about 100 PNGs to GIFs, and as a result, had uglier icons.\n\n",

During one such time, a customer tried to add a page to favourites 3 times and thus when the server began processing, it ended up adding three rows into the content_label table. Now when trying to remove the page from favourites, it results in the error covered by CONF-13516. The customer should not be able to get into a situation like this. \n\nTo prevent this situation, we can add more constraints on the database level.\n\nA similar problem occurs with the content table for pages and blog posts. There are no database restrictions on page title + space key + version uniqueness for pages, so there's a race condition where two requests to save a page come in at exactly the same time, check for an existing version -- don't find one -- and proceed with saving the new version in duplicate.\n\nHowever, implementing this in the CONTENT table is a tad difficult, where the restrictions would need to be based on the CONTENTTYPE column being \"PAGE\" or \"BLOGPOST\". We can't implement this in a database independent way with Hibernate. The CONTENT table would need to be split up by class to implement this for all customers, which raises a whole host of other problems.\n\nOur current recommendation is that customers investigate implementing the database constraints themselves if they are interested in getting this additional level of security. In general, Confluence is designed to handle the duplicates gracefully rather than prevent them in the first place. (Hence CONF-13516 where multiple labels caused problems is fixed as a bug separate to this improvement.)\n",

This jar file can be shipped to a customer instead of a 'textual' description of the licence code. \nCustomer that may deploy this {{jar}} and it will have the licence key embedded in it. Thus allowing the application to be instantiated with a valid licence.\n\nFurther, we can have a jar file that would contain functionality to disable licence when a 'refund' licence is used or a new licence is provided when the previous one has not expired yet. The class inside the jar can do 'all the work' to check and verify the currently deployed licence on that application, compare it with it's server id and perform all necessary tasks to disabling it's use and substituting it with a new licence.\n\n\n\n",

But, pages that start with special characters or numbers don't have a place, so they aren't included. In addition to the A to Z buttons for the index \"table of contents\" you should add a button for \"Other\" or else two buttons (one for \"Numeric\" and one for \"Other\").\n\nThanks,\nEric",

The current command I am using for a tab named 'R1 Schedule' is\n \n{calendar:id=R1Schedule\\|title=CCIE Rack 1 Schedule}\n \nI would like to have the same exact layout and options except for one slight difference. When one adds an event, I would like the time frame to be limited. Normal users are to only be able to add an event from the current day, up to a maximum of 14 days\n \nFor example. If I come to add an event, I can only add an event for today, and not a future day. Also, there would be a drop down box that allows me to select the numbers of days I would be scheduling the event for.  ie. 1, 2, 3, ..., 6, 7     and possibly have the drop down box up to 14 days.\n \nAn example of some code I have viewed from a website I have seen is:\n\n<select name=\"daysneeded\" onChange=\"addDays(this.options[this.options.selectedIndex].value)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<option value=\"initial\">initial</option>\n\t\t\t\t</select>\n\nThis creates a drop down box with preset values; the values I need are from 1 up to 14 days. The header above that drop down box is \"Days Needed\"\n\nLastly, I also need to allow an administrator to be able to add events at any time, current or future. This is for reservation purposes.\n \nI appreciate your time and help.",
