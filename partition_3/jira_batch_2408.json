I worked on branch removing-pattern-recognition-properties and I had several commits already (they were displayed on bitbucket). After that I merged origin/develop into my branch, resolved the conflicts and committed\\pushed the changes. After that I noticed, that Bitbucket showed me, that there are no any commits for my branch. Also I noticed, that for other branches it shows the same. I have no rights to commit directly to develop branch. Screenshot from Bitbucket and git logs are attached.\n\nLocally everything looks fine: I have commits in history. If I checkout branch from the repo - commits are lost.\n\n\u200c\n\nI created removing-pattern-recognition-properties-new branch from my last commit. After it it shows the changes on click, but still shows incorrect number of commits in Behind column.",

Summary\nIn \"New Pull request experience\" the &#x27;Edit&#x27; and &#x27;Decline&#x27; links in a PR are missing for PR authors that have read only access to the destination repo\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n# Create 2 Bitbucket accounts, account-1 and account-2\n# From account-1, create repo-A owned by account-1\n# Create a fork of repo-A, named repo-A-fork, again owned by account-1\n# Grant to account-2 read-only access to repo-A\n# Grant to account-2 write-access to repo-A-fork\n# Log in to Bitbucket account account-2\n# From account-2, create some commits to repo-A-fork\n# From account-2, open a PR from repo-A-fork to repo-A\n\nh3. Expected Results\nThe links &#x27;Edit&#x27; and &#x27;Decline&#x27; in the PR should be visible to the PR author (account-2).\n\nh3.
