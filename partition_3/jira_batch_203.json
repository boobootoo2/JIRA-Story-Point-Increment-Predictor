With the first release, the Manage Sprints permission will be created, and existing users with the Administer Project permission will be assigned the new permission for the same projects. The same sprint actions will check for the new permission, so it will be business as usual.\r\nThe following sprint-related actions will now be assigned to specific users in your team, thereby separating these from the actions that come with the Administer Project permission:\r\n* Creating sprints\r\n* Starting sprints\r\n* Completing sprints\r\n* Editing sprint information (sprint name and dates)\r\n* Reordering sprints  (currently only future sprints)\r\n* Deleting sprints (currently only future sprints)\r\n* Reopening sprints\r\n* Moving the sprint footer\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nUsers should now be able to manage Sprints, this include Starting and completing sprints, by only having this new implemented permission: \"Manage Sprints\" permission.\r\nHowever, some users who have both \"Manage Sprints\" and \"Administer Projects\" are not being able to fulfil any of the actions above unless they are also *\"JIRA Administrators\"*, a permission that shouldn't be needed.\r\n\r\nh3.

Expected Results\r\nHaving the *Manage Sprints* permission should be enough to enable the user to complete the actions described above.\r\n\r\nh3.

      "description": "Currently, a person is allowed to manage a sprint (start/stop them, add/remove issues, etc.) if they have the required combination of project permissions in all projects \"visible\" to a sprint. While [#GHS-5035] will change how these permissions are structured, the permissions are still entirely governed by whether the user has permissions in a particular project or set of projects. This means there is no way for sprints/boards/teams that work on the same project(s) to be unable to manage sprints that are not from their board. This causes several problems:\r\n\r\n# Because only one sprint on a board can be open at a time, two teams working on the same project cannot work in separate sprints. I admit that this is not very \"Scrum\" but it is a *huge* problem for us. The current restrictions do not prevent work being done on the same project in different sprints anyway, you just need to have a second project on each board that differs between the two teams, i.e. Team 1 can work on Projects 1 and 2 while Team 2 work on Projects 2 and 3, but not if they both work only on Projects 1 and 2. N.B. There is a setting in JIRA Software Labs that can allow parallel sprints, please keep this feature!\r\n# Issues can easily be added to the wrong sprint, and users are presented with many sprints they should not have to see when choosing a sprint.\r\n# In our company we turn over a large number of small projects (one of the main reasons we have cross-functional teams that can collaborate on any specific project). Maintaining project-specific board filters for each board would be very complex and time consuming and very prone to issues getting \"lost\" if assigned to a user using a board that does not reference the relevant project, and nowhere near as elegant as an \"assignee in membersOf(...)\" type filter which is all that should be necessary for a team-centric board.\r\n\r\nMy argument is that Scrum boards and their associated sprints do not fundamentally map to a set of projects, they map to a particular team. In \"pure\" Scrum, a team works on a single project, and so there is an implied mapping from sprint to project which would mean project permissions would be sufficient to control who can manage a given set of sprints. However, JIRA Software is no longer called JIRA Agile and \"Scrum\" boards are based on any JQL query not on a list of projects, so I do not accept the notion that they are solely intended to be used with unique project mappings.\r\n\r\nHence, I believe there are two types of permission that need to be available:\r\n\r\n* Issue-based permissions that decide whether the user can add *that* issue to *any* sprint. These are the permissions that are currently in place.\r\n* Board-based permissions that decide whether the user can add *any* issue to *that* sprint. These are the permissions I would like to have implemented.\r\n\r\nSome solutions that would be fine for us:\r\n\r\n# Add a requirement that someone managing a sprint (starting/stopping/deleting/adding/removing/etc.) should not only have the project permissions already in place, but must also be an administrator on the \"origin board\" (see [#GHS-5035], [#comment-785773]) for that sprint. \r\n# Create a separate field on the board (\"Scrum Masters\" or \"Sprint Managers\"?) as opposed to using the existing Board Admin.\r\n\r\nWhat would *not* be workable is to do it based on who the board filter is shared with. We need many more people to be able to view a board than to be able to manage it (obviously).\r\n\r\nWhile planning, a user should only see sprints that they are able to manage, and they should be able to start that sprint even if other open sprints visible to the board but with a different origin board (that correspond to other teams working on the same project(s)) exist.",

If not all epics are shown, not all issues will be shown.\r\n\r\nThe issue caused is that the number above the columns on the board will always show the total number of issues, regardless of the number of issues that are shown after swimlanes are created. This will cause confusion for users, as the total in the column might report 17 issues, while only 5 might be visible based on what the swimlanes and filter show.\r\n\r\nI am suggesting that we make that number more accurate when swimlanes are created. For example, a board without swimlanes might show something like \"17 out of 17 issues shown\", whereas once some issues disappear from the board when epic swimlanes are created, that number might show as \"5 out of 17 issues shown\" (the wording could of course be different).",

This behavior is based on a Kanban board with the following filter: \r\n\r\nreporter = currentUser() ORDER BY Rank ASC\r\n\r\n* The observations made refer to \"you\" and other users. Since the filter is based on the current user, \"you\" will refer to whatever user you are logged in as.\r\n* The first three observations are the product working as it should. The fourth observation is where the product is causing an issue.\r\n\r\n1. Subtasks you reported, under a task you also reported that does not have an epic link will show under the swimlane \"Issues without epics\". (The task will show under that swimlane as well).\r\n2. Subtasks you reported, under a task you also reported, under an epic you reported will also show, under the swimlane associated with that epic.\r\n3. Subtasks you reported, under a task you reported, under an epic reported by someone else will not show, as the subtask is going to inherit the epic link from the parent task, and this epic was not reported by you.\r\n\r\nFor each of these observations, you can see that it follows the hierarchy of Epic > Task > Subtask, which is as it should be.\r\n\r\nNow, here is the behavior that is an issue:\r\n\r\n4. A subtask reported by you, under a task reported BY ANOTHER USER, under an Epic reported BY ANOTHER USER, will in fact show up under the swimlane \"Issues without epics\". What this appears to show is that the subtask will not even look at the epic link of the parent task since it has been reported by another user, and based on your filter, will show in that swimlane.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n* To see the behavior, make sure to have epics, tasks, and subtasks reported by the users that match each observation in the above summary.\r\n\r\n# Create a Kanban board with the following filter: reporter = currentUser() ORDER BY Rank ASC\r\n# Login as the \"you\" user referred to in the above observations.\r\n# View board as is.

Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe subtask created under observation #4 should not show up in the results, as the epic the parent task is linked to was not created by the current user. The subtask should look at the parent task and see that the parent IS linked to an epic and should not show at all. It is incorrect for the product to say that the subtask is without an epic.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe subtask does show under the \"Issues without epics\" swimlane, which is incorrect.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\nThere is no workaround at this time.",

      "description": "h3. Summary\r\n\r\nAfter the release of Project Types and new Application Access (Core and Software) in JIRA 7, there are two problems to access Release pages for anonymous users:\r\n# Anonymous users no longer can see the icon to go to the Releases page of this project, though they strangely can use URL to go to it (if they know it).\r\n# When they access this page via URL, clicking any version leads to an unaccessible page (the version hub for that version)\r\n\r\nThis is probably because development features are now only visible to Software users. However, this is highly inconsistent as an icon to an accessible page is gone, and once we manage to access the page, the links in it are not accessible.\r\n\r\nAlso, shouldn't public projects allow access to these pages to anonymous users?\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create a public software project (change Permission Scheme to add 'anyone' to the 'Browse Projects' permission)\r\n# Access the project as an anonymous user (not logged in)\r\n# In the project's left menu, the releases icon is not visible (*problem 1*):\r\n!icon_gone.png|thumbnail!\r\n# Since navigating to it is not possible, copy the URL to it and paste it (replace instance and project key):\r\n{noformat}\r\nhttps://instance.atlassian.net/projects/PROJECTKEY?selectedItem=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin:release-page\r\n{noformat}\r\n#* Now we can see the page we couldn't access before\r\n# Clicking a version leads to a page like this (*problem 2*):\r\n!error.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nIt reads:\r\n{panel}\r\nSorry, you can't view this page\r\nThis page is only available to JIRA Software users. If you think you should be a JIRA Software user, you should ask your administrator to give you application access to JIRA Software.\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n# All these pages are accessible (as this is a public project)\r\n#* The icon is visible\r\n#* The link to the version lead to an accessible page\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThe ones described in the Steps to Reproduce.\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\nAlso, the documentation is not reflecting these changes. What should public project show now to anonymous users? Only JIRA Core features or should it include JIRA Software?\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\nNone so far.",

So no other sprints belonging to other boards should show up in the report. {panel}\r\n\r\nh3. Summary\r\n\r\nVelocity report include sprints from other boards. \r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\n* 2016-01-18 Cloud, 2016-02-01 Cloud\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nBasically this might happen in the following scenario:\r\n* You have Board A with filter \"project = A\". You have Sprint 1 with issue A-1, A-2 inside it. The Sprint 1 has to be a future Sprint otherwise it correctly shows up in the report.\r\n* You have Board B with filter \"project = B\". You have Sprint 2 with issue B-1,B-2 inside it. The Sprint 2 has to be a future Sprint otherwise it correctly shows up in the report.\r\n\r\nIf issue A-1 is moved to Sprint B it means that Sprint B will contain 1 issue that match the filter of Board A, thus will make Sprint B APPEAR in board A. If that happen then the velocity report of board A will include Sprint B too. \r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nVelocity Report should only show sprints from other boards if the issues were moved between active sprints, not in planning phase (between future sprints).\r\nAs moving issues to-from sprints affects velocity (committed/completed), the report should show it accordingly.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n* The chart include Sprint outside the scope of the board, and Sprint might result empty. \r\n\r\n!velocity.png|thumbnail!\r\n \r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\n\r\nNo workaround. ",
