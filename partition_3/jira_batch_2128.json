Description \r\nWe would like to be able to include a single field from a JIRA issue in a Confluence page.\r\n\r\nA very similar question was asked on [Atlassian Community|https://community.atlassian.com/]:\r\n\r\n- [Viewing single filelds of an issue in Confluence|https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Jira-questions/viewing-single-fields-of-an-issue-in-Confluence/qaq-p/182751]\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nHowever, we need to be able to do this without resorting to Rest and JSON. Apparently it used to be an option in the JIRA Issues macro, but the functionality was removed. The enhancement could either be for it to be restored, or for a separate macro to be created.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nPossible workaround discussed in below thread in [Atlassian Community|https://community.atlassian.com/]:\r\n- [How to display Jira Issue field values in Confluence page|https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Confluence-questions/How-to-display-Jira-Issue-field-values-in-Confluence-page/qaq-p/227374]\r\n",

Steps to Reproduce\n# Create a user (example: _test_) in JIRA that has the *Administer Projects* permission\n# Create an application link between JIRA and Confluence\n# Create a new user in Confluence with the same username and remove that user from any groups\n# Give the user \"Can Use\" permission ONLY, in Confluence Global Permissions\n# Ensure that there are no spaces in Confluence with Anonymous access permission, so that the user will be in read-only mode.\n# Install JIRA Agile in JIRA\n# Create a Scrum project\n# Login as user _test_\n# Click the *Linked Page > Create Page* button in Scrum's Plan mode\n\nh5. Expected Results\nUser will be shown something like an error or _not permitted_ page. This is because anonymous users are not allowed to create contents in Confluence.\n\nh5. Actual Results\nCreate Page dialog will pop-up, and the Loading icon will spin endlessly. The *Create* button seems to be missing as well.\n!loading.png|thumbnail!",

Since CONNECTOR retrieve group membership using the LDAP synchronisation process, it is not necessary to retrieve the group membership during authentication process as well.\n\nBy forcing user membership retrieval during authentication process could cause performance issue during authentication process. Especially if customer is using SSL connection due to this [bug|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-35735]. This authentication performance issue will get worst if nested group membership is enabled.\n\n*Propose Solution*\n\nProvide an option for administrators to skip user membership retrieval during authentication in the directory configuration.

Right now we are testing agains the m22 version. We have some problems regarding the inline comments editor, the popup with the button does not show up when I highlight text. \n\nThe cause of this seems to be that the area the highlighter looks in is selected using $(\".wiki-content\").first(), whereas we render content in multiple containers with that class-name.\n\nWe had a similar problem with the jira issue creator in confluence 5.4, and we received a javascript snippet (which let us specify another selector) to fix it that time. Could we get a similar fix for this, or do you have any other suggestions?\n\nBest Regards,\nAndreas\nRefinedWiki",

Problem summary\nSince Confluence 5.4, it is possible create JIRA issues by highlighting text on a Confluence page. A dialog will pop-up over the highlighted text, with an option to create a comment from the quote, or to create an issue in JIRA.\n\nHowever, we've observed instances where the Create JIRA option is missing (but the comment-from-quote option is still there) seemingly intermittently, without explicit change to the system from users or administrators.\n\nh2. Troubleshooting\nThere can be more than one cause for this Create JIRA ticket option to not appear with text highlights:\n* The plugin {{Confluence and Jira Content Connector}} might be disabled\n* The plugin {{Page Highlight Actions}} might be disabled\n* The individual user might have the \"Show option panel when text is selected\" setting unchecked in {{Profile > Settings}}\n\nHowever, in the cases Support has observed, these avenues have already been explored. There are no errors in logs or in the UI, and the intermittent nature makes this issue particularly difficult to troubleshoot. The JIRA icon is simply missing when text is highlighted.\n\nh2. Steps to reproduce\nThis issue is intermittent, and we do not have clear steps to reproduce. However, the problem appears to be with the in-memory cache.\n\nh2. Workaround\nWe've found that the problem may be related to an in-memory cache store, and some customers have had success getting the functionality back by flushing the cache (via {{Confluence Admin > Cache Management (or Cache Statistics) > Flush all}}). Restarting Confluence may also restore the functionality.\n\nALSO:\nRunning a Content Index from Confluence administration >> Content indexing >> Rebuild, will clear this out.\n\n(!) Confluence Cloud instances will need to file a support request at https://support.atlassian.com to request we run this for you due to permission restrictions on both flushing cache and content indexing.",

Reasoning:\nWhen performing imports they can sometimes fail due to invalid characters in entities.xml. This requires manually stripping the characters (normally with a perl script) within the files and subsequently compressing them back. If the compression is done incorrectly (for example, a user compresses the containing directory and not the files themselves), the import then fails again due to being unable to find the exportDescriptor.properties file. This process (of fixing the entities.xml to remove invalid characters, compressing it, and then after it fails figuring out the correct way to compress the files) is extremely frustrating and time consuming for both customers and Atlassian Support.\n\nh3. Specific Improvements:\n- Strip invalid characters from entities.xml during import\n- Look for export descriptor.properties recursively in the backup file (and not just in the top level)\n",

Meaning we see 25 and it lists 25 but when we try to make changes to Confluence it seems to say we are over the limit.  We have purchased 50 more recently, but I wanted to have Attlassian take a look to see if I am missing something or why this seems to be off by one.  If you could take a look and advise what may have caused this would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThank You,\nLester\nMobile Heartbeat\n",
