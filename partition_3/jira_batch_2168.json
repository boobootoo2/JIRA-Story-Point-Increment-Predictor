Steps to Reproduce\nLet's say we have a user called userX and userY\n# Create a new page titled PageA\n# Add some content and mention @userX in the page\n# Save the page\n# UserX will receive a mention notification email\n# Edit PageA\n# Mention @userY \n# Mention @userX\n# Save the page\n# UserY will receive a mention notification email\n# UserX will *not* receive a mention notification email\n\nI'm not sure if this is by design that one user, would get only, one mention notification email, per one single content object (page/comment/blogpost). If so, I'd think this would fall under improvement rather than a bug, but we should clarify further about it in [its doc|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Using+Mentions].\n\n\n{panel:title=Atlassian Status as of February 14, 2017|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#3C78B5| titleBGColor=#3C78B5| bgColor=#E7F4FA}\n\nHi All,\n\nThank you for your feedback on this issue thus far. This behaviour is currently by design. Due to the ongoing interest in this, the issue has been moved from a Bug to Suggestion to continue to track your feedback.\n\nIt is also worth pointing out that this behaviours does not apply to tasks. If a task [] is created on a page with an @mention, the user WILL receive a task notification email.\n\nConfluence Product Management\n\n{panel}",

Steps to Reproduce\n# Find an image with CMYK colour profile\n# Attach the image to a page\n# Edit the page\n# Inserting the image itself is fine\n# Go to Insert - Link > Attachments (or just Insert - Attachment) and you will see the error: \"There was an error communicating with the server, please try again later.'\n\nh3. Workaround\n* Open the image in image editing software and save it, specifying RGB as the colour profile if required. Usually just saving the file will convert the colour profile, on most simple image editing software.\n* If you require the CMYK profile on the images, the workaround is to embed them directly in the page, by Insert - Image. This will display the image, and it works fine. It is only thumbnails that have the problem.\n* Host/upload the images to somewhere else (e.g. Dropbox, image hosting site, external site, etc.), then insert the image link through {{Insert - Link > Web Link}}. \n\nNB: Reproduced on the initial customer's space and on a clean instance of 4.2.11.",

HOW did this Shortcut ever make it?) also has a action bound to this shortcut it does not work.\n\nWe could keep reporting in \"X+Y doesn't work under Z Browser\" but new shortcuts may emerge and we can do that all over again. Or it might be thrown back and forth among different browsers as we suddenly just hit a shortcut used by IE or FF etc.\n\nSo instead of that, let people customize the shortcuts instead, allowing to optionally use up to 2 modifier keys. So i could bind Edit to Ctrl+Shift+E or Ctrl+Q to circumvent the issue with Ctrl+E\n\nThat way you should effectively once and for all eliminate the need for any further reports on \"colliding\" shortcut keys...\n\n",

I have attached my test, and a screenshot of the original page I used to create the document. If you click in the right place, you can select the image, but no amount of moving, copying or resizing will convince it to display.\n\nThis is for regular inline images, not generated images (----CONF-25599----).\nh4. Steps to reproduce:\n # Add a new page.\n # Insert an image by going \"Insert\" -> \"Image\", then upload an image and attach it.\n # Save the page.\n # Go to \"Tools\" -> \"Export to Word\" and open the resulting *.doc file in Word for Mac 2011 and 2010.\n -- The image will not be visible, and just show a blank line in its place.\n -- Opening the same *.doc file in Word running on Windows will show the image.\n\nh4. Resolution:\n\nAfter investigation, it appears this issue has been fixed in Microsoft Office 2016. As our documentation\u00a0currently lists\u00a0Microsoft Office\u00a02013 as the earliest supported version ([https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/office-connector-prerequisites-170493096.html)]\u00a0, and there is\u00a0no 2013 Office for mac,\u00a0it is recommended that customers upgrade to Office 2016 to resolve this issue.\u00a0Office 2016 has only been tested with Confluence 6.0.x. So while there is no fix contained in version 6.0.1, it is recommended that you upgrade to this version when you upgrade to Office 2016.",

Note - as of Confluence 5.1.3 you can make an SSL LDAP connection that doesn't verify that the hostname and certificate match by unchecking this box when configuring your user directory:\n\n!Screen Shot 2013-04-16 at 3.10.37 PM.png!\n\n----\nh5. Original issue description\n\nStarting Confluence 4.2, the embedded crowd has been upgraded from version 2.3.2 to 2.4. This includes the security fix [CWD-2690] (won't be visible to public) that has been announced in Crowd 2.3.6 release notes - [Crowd 2.3.6 Release Notes|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CROWD/Crowd+2.3.6+Release+Notes].\n\nIn Confluence, this has caused a lot of issues to customers with SSL-ed LDAP integration. Mainly because Confluence used to not verify that the server's SSL certificate is valid for the host name in the LDAP connection URL.\n\nIn Crowd, one can still have the old behaviour by workarounding it:\n{quote}\nAs a workaround for deployments where there is an expected difference, using an 'ldaps' connection URL and leaving 'Secure SSL' unchecked will preserve the previous behaviour and make an SSL connection but will not verify that the hostname and certificate match.\n{quote}\n\nHowever, in Confluence, once you enable \"Use SSL\", there is no way we can fallback to the old behaviour like Crowd above.\n!SSL_UserDirectory.png!\n\nThis feature request is to propose to have similar config/option like Crowd to allow an SSL LDAP connection but without verifying that the hostname and certificate match (fix of CWD-2690).\n\nh5. Workaround options\n\n# Fix the certificate to contain the correct name. This is the preferred (and most secure) fix.\n# Edit /etc/hosts on the LDAP server to allow you to use the incorrect name in the certificate. Add the FQDN on the certificate and match it to the IP address of the server.\n# (!) Backup Confluence database beforehand for safety purpose\n#- Run the following SQL query:\n{code}\nUPDATE cwd_directory_attribute\nSET attribute_value='false'\nWHERE attribute_name='ldap.secure'\nAND directory_id  = <desired_directory_ID>;\n{code} \n#- Restart Confluence\n#- (i) *Note*: The above option will always reverted to its default ('true') whenever you edit the user directory settings. Therefore, you'll need to run that query every time you do any changes on the user directory settings.",

Problem\nCurrently editing macros is a *bit of slow* and not the quick \"wiki\" way. What I mean by this? Well, let's take a look at the *excerpt macro*. You have a page where there is a wall of text and a excerpt macro, alright now you think hey \"I could be able to make this page _less_ confusing with just  hiding the excerpt macro.. no biggie..\" and you start to hide the macro:\n# You have to click *edit*\n# You have to *select* the excerpt macro\n# You have to click *Edit*\n# You have to check the box that says *Hide Excerpted Content*\n# You have to click *Save*\n# Then you have to write to the \"What did you change?\" text area\n# THEN you have to uncheck the \"Notify watchers\"\n# Then you think \"PHEW this was hard.. And only one tiny edit..\"\n# Then you click *Save*\n\nh2. Solution suggestion\nIt would be more *easier and more quicker* way to do these *little* check box edits if you could just change the value just from selecting the macro.\n\nThere could be like \"*Edit*\", \"*Remove*\" and \"*Hide*\"(When pressed it changes to a button tht says says \"*Unhide*\").\n\nPicture representation:\n!example2.png!\n\nI *don't know* if this ability is available/documented for the macro/usermacro developers. If by any chance this is available it would be nice to see this feature to be used in more macros.\n",

This means people are not going to be aware of it, and therefore less likely to be used: if it were visible all the time then it would be more likely to be used.\n{quote}\n\nand another point:\n\n{quote}\nAnother thing I notice with the current position of the Like icon is that it gets a bit lost if there's other things below it, such as comments (check attachment).\n\nIf it was on the right of the screen, where the Labels icon is, it wouldn't be so lost.
