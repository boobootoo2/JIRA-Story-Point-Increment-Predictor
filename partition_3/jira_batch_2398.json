Issue Summary\r\n\r\nAssume that you have a JIRA workspace integrated with a JIRA Cloud instance, and in one of the workspace's repos you enable the option \"Require issue keys in commit messages\".\r\n\r\nIf you transfer this repository to a different workspace that doesn't have an integration with JIRA, then this option remains enabled and it is not possible to deselect it.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, it is not possible to push new commits, either with or without an issue key in their message.\r\n The error that is shown is \"The commit message does not contain a valid issue key.\"\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Integrate a Bitbucket workspace with a JIRA Cloud instance\r\n # Enable the option \"Require issue keys in commit messages\" in one of the repos owned by this workspace\r\n # Transfer the repository to a different workspace that doesn't have a JIRA Cloud integration\r\n # Accept the transfer request\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe \"Require issue keys in commit messages\" option remains editable, and the user can enable/disable it.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe \"Require issue keys in commit messages\" option is not editable, it remains selected and the user cannot disable it.\r\n Additionally, if the user tries to push to the repository, new commits are not accepted with the error \"The commit message does not contain a valid issue key.\", even if the commit messages contain an issue key. (I believe this is due to the fact that there are no links in this repository)\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\n1. If a user integrates the workspace that the repo is transferred to with the same JIRA Cloud instance, then it is possible to edit the \"Require issue keys in commit messages\" option.\r\n\r\n2. As an alternative, the user can inspect the page with e.g. Developer Tools in Chrome, inspect the button, and then remove the word \"disabled\" from the HTML code. This will allow the user to deselect the option.",

Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Creating a branch\r\n ## In a repository with 26 branches or more, open the branches page\r\n ## Click on *Create Branch*\r\n ## On the *From branch*\u00a0dropdown, specify the branch that you want as parent. Note only 25 branches are displayed.\u00a0This is not possible to create a branch from a parent if that is parent branch is\u00a0not in the list of 25 branches\r\n # Setting the Main branch\r\n ## Go to *Repository settings*\u00a0in a repository with 26 branches or more\r\n ## Expand *ADVANCED* button on the right side\r\n ## Click on *Main branch* dropdown to select the Main branch\r\n ## Specify branch to be setup as main branch,\u00a0note 25 branches are displayed. This is not possible to setup the main branch if that is not listed in the list of 25 branches\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nIf a filter matches the exact branch, the branch would be displayed.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nSearching for a branch using a pattern, if its not listed in the top 25 results, the branch won't be displayed.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\n*While searching for the branch in a Create branch page*\r\n \u00a0 As a workaround, it is possible to create a branch based on another branch locally and then push the new branch to Bitbucket.\r\n *While searching for the branch in setting the main branch*\r\n \u00a0 As a workaround, use the old view of the page by adding _*spa=0*_ at the end of the URL. For example: [https://bitbucket.org/]<repo_owner>/<repo_slug>/admin?spa=0. You should be able to get list of all branches matching the pattern.",

      "description": "Folks,\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nI've been a big fan of Atlassian products for years, and as a developer, I've always preferred the Bitbucket product over github. I would use both in the free account capacity here...but recently, I've hit a limit with Bitbucket of only being able to share repositories with a maximum of 5 users. I received the following email:\r\n\r\n!image-2020-08-17-14-10-11-841.png|width=409,height=440!\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nI then checked out what github's free account has to offer:\r\n\r\n!image-2020-08-17-14-11-35-192.png|width=214,height=412!\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nSeems like Bitbucket is lagging on the developer/free offering, and as inconvenient it is for me to move all of my code repositories off of Bitbucket and onto github, it seems like it is the logical thing to do to meet my needs.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIf you have any response to this, short term, that would allow me to continue to use Bitbucket and be able to collaborate with more than 5 users, please let me know - otherwise, I hope you consider this feedback for the long term otherwise you will lose a lot of developer market share to github.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThank you for your time.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
