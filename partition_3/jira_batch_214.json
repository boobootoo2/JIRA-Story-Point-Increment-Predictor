      "description": "Hello,\r\nIn Kanban, you can use the boards throughput to estimate future projects based on future data. The throughput is measured in issues/day.\r\n\r\nFor instance, if you know that your team has an average throughput of 0.5 issues/day and you have 10 issues to deal with, you can make a good estimation by saying that it would take 10 * 0.5 = 20 days. For a better estimation, you can also consider your bug/feature ration (the average number of bugs you introduce for every new feature). So if you have bug/feature ratio of 0.4 and you have 10 features to add, you should in fact count 14 issues.\r\n\r\nSo the feature would be the following:\r\n* On the Kanban board report's, dislay the current values and the historic for the rolling average throughput, a bit like in the current control flow chart for Kanban boards. The throughput should be calculated based on the time it takes for an issue to cross the board, like cycle time.\r\n* Also display somewhere the bug/feature ratio on the same page.\r\n\r\nBefore moving to Jira we were calculating the throughput based on our post-it notes and it proved to be a very valuable tool. I am missing this in Jira.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you have any question.\r\n\r\nThanks!",

Cause\r\nSomehow, on these instances, an issue was given a value for its rank that occurred outside the minimum- and maxiumum-marker row's values.\r\n\r\nHere's an example of the breached values:\r\n\r\n|| FIELD_ID || ID || ISSUE_ID || LOCK_HASH || LOCK_TIME || RANK || TYPE ||\r\n| 10200 | 748 | 11196 |  |  | 0\\|zzzzzz:i | 1 |\r\n| 10200 | 3 | 9223372036854775807 |  |  | 0\\|zzzzzz: | 2 |\r\n| 10200 | 704 | 11152 |  |  | 0\\|zzzzzv: | 1 |\r\n| 10200 | 747 | 11195 |  |  | 0\\|zzzzzs: | 1 |\r\n| 10200 | 745 | 11193 |  |  | 0\\|zzzzzc: | 1 |\r\n| 10200 | 744 | 11192 |  |  | 0\\|zzzzz4: | 1 |\r\n| 10200 | 743 | 11191 |  |  | 0\\|zzzzyw: | 1 |\r\n| 10200 | 740 | 11188 |  |  | 0\\|zzzzyg: | 1 |\r\n| 10200 | 739 | 11187 |  |  | 0\\|zzzzy8: | 1 |\r\n| 10200 | 738 | 11186 |  |  | 0\\|zzzzy0: | 1 |\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how the rank of {{0|zzzzzz:i}} was set, but it causes problems: The LexoRankBalanceOperation expects the MAXIMUM_ or MINIMUM_MARKER_ROW to be the first row returned in a SQL query where the rows are ordered by RANK. If any value appears before the marker row in their respective queries, integrity exceptions will be raised upon most LexoRank operations.\r\n\r\nSince LexoRank operations occur when issues are deleted, these integrity exceptions actively prevent issues from being deleted.\r\n\r\nThe integrity violation also prevents a re-balancing from occurring, so attempts to heal the rankings probably won't work, either.\r\n\r\nh4. Workaround\r\n\r\nYou can manually edit the rank values in the LEXORANK ActiveObjects table.\r\n\r\n# Get all the values in the lexorank table: {code:sql}SELECT * FROM \"AO_60DB71_LEXORANK\" ORDER BY \"RANK\" DESC;{code}\r\n# Determine the # of rows that appear above the maximum value (i.e., the row of type='2'). In the above example, there is just one: \\\\ {noformat}| 10200 | 748 | 11196 |  |  | 0|zzzzzz:i | 1 |{noformat}\r\n# Determine the rank value of the maximum value. In the above example, it is {{0|zzzzzz:}}\r\n# Determine the highest rank value below the maximum. In the above example, it is {{0|zzzzzv:}}\r\n# Determine the possible values between the maximum value and the value you found in step 3.\\\\ In our example, the values are {{0|zzzzzz:}} and {{0|zzzzzv:}}, respectively. \\\\ The possible values between here are {{0|zzzzzw:}}, {{0|zzzzzx:}} and {{0|zzzzzy:}}.\r\n# For each issue above the maximum value, update the row to use one of the values determined in step 4. {code:sql}UPDATE \"AO_60DB71_LEXORANK\" SET \"RANK\"=<that value> WHERE \"ID\"=<the row's id>;{code}\r\nDo the same for any rows that fall below the minimum value: {code:sql}SELECT * FROM \"AO_60DB71_LEXORANK\" ORDER BY \"RANK\" ASC;{code}\r\n# Once all of that is done, trigger a LexoRankBalanceOperation to occur. You can do this by issuing a GET request to {{/rest/greenhopper/1.0/lexorank/balance}} with an admin's credentials.",

      "description": "I've noticed that viewing an Agile Wallboard Gadget that makes use of a board's quick filter(s) can impact the appearance of the actual Agile board referenced by the gadget when you switch over to it.  When you switch from the dashboard to the Agile board, the URL will use the filter settings that were applied to the gadget on the dashboard, BUT the corresponding filters do not have the visual cue that they are being applied.  This results in an inverted behavior for those filter buttons (i.e. turning the filter 'on' actually turns it 'off').\r\n\r\nSo the problem is two-fold.  First, the gadget's filter settings replace any user stored filter settings - a very minor inconvenience. Second, the behavior of those filters becomes inverted, which can be rather confusing for users.\r\n\r\nThe steps to reproduce this bug are:\r\n1. Create an Agile board with some quick filters and create a dashboard that uses the Agile Wallboard Gadget, which is configured to apply at least one of those quick filters.\r\n2. View the dashboard.\r\n3. View the Agile board.\r\n4. Compare the applied quick filters in the URL to which ones are applied visually in the UI.\r\n\r\nThis bug does not seem to occur 100% of the time, but does seem to occur the majority of the time.",

      "description": "JIRA Agile assumes that the statuses in the left-most column equate to Not Started and the statuses in the right-most column equate to Done. A more flexible implementation would allow us to use checkboxes when configuring our boards to indicate which column(s) are Not Started columns and which column(s) are Done columns.\r\n\r\nFor example, we use a four-step workflow for stories (Not Started->In Progress->In Review->Done). We also have the additional states of Blocked and Dropped which can be transitioned to from any state.\r\n\r\nI'd like to set my Scrum Board up with six columns in this order (Not Started, In Progress, In Review, Done, Blocked, Dropped). But Done and Dropped need to share the last column--otherwise we have problems closing Sprints with a mixture of done and dropped stories or sub-tasks. When Done and Dropped share the last column, there is no visual indication the story (or task) is Done or Dropped unless the details of the story (or task) are inspected. Even worse, we had to allow transition of stories to Done from any state to match the transition to Dropped from any state. Otherwise, a user might attempt to drag a story from In Progress to Done (skipping In Review) and JIRA Agile would silently put it in Dropped state (since there is no legal transition from In Progress to Done).\r\n\r\nOn the left-side of the board, if I put Blocked to the left of Not Started, JIRA Agile counts my Not Started stories as In Progress when looking at the story point accumulation, which is incorrect.",

I understand the blah blah reasons, but not accepting of those reasons.  Even just for consistency / minimising confusion it should be there.\r\n- Plenty of teams may have a primary Scrum board (and even then because it's the only view which provides a Plan/triage view).  And those teams may also use Kanban boards for other purposes - but confusingly aren't able to use the useful Epic data that it available.\r\n- Sure, workaround is available by manually configuring swimlanes by specific Epic, but that's really arduous to setup, maintain and sequence.\r\n",

Naturally they mustn't see any information except for the projects where they have at least browse permission.\r\n\r\nWith the current Agile setup it is easy to make mistakes regarding the visibility of boards. Once the base for the board is a filter that is shared with anyone, even people that don't have access to a project get to know that there's a board \"Customer XY Kanban Board\" or such.\r\n\r\nI understand that filters can span more than one project, so my suggestion would be that the user is guided with hints (or sensible defaults).\r\n* When creating a new board from a saved filter (visible for everyone) that contains \"project = X\" as restriction there should be a hint that the recommended share level is with project only. I would be OK with Jira changing the visibility of the filter to project only after a popup asking for agreement.\r\n* When changing the filter for an existing board the same recommendations should occur.\r\n\r\nAlternatively:\r\nMaybe Agile should get a full-featured permission management where (independently of filter) the visibility and other permissions can be configured.
