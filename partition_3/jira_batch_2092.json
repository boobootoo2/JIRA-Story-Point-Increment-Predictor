Problem Summary\nUsers are able to edit any Space Questions as long as they have View permissions for that space. This includes questions asked by other users. Users do not need to have Space Admin or even Add/Edit Page permissions to the space, only View is required.\n\nThis is inconsistent when compared to global questions (not tied to any specific space) which require either Confluence Administrator permissions or specific permissions granted based on CQ points levels. (Source: https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/QUESTIONS/Permissions)\n\nh2. Steps to reproduce\n# Environment: Tested with Confluence 5.7.1 + Confluence Questions 2.1.3.\n# Create a question in a Space\n# Log in as a different user with only View permissions to that space, and navigate to the question\n\nh2. Expected behavior\nThe user will be able to view, but not modify, the question\n\nh2. Actual behavior\nThe Edit option will be present, and functional, for this user",
