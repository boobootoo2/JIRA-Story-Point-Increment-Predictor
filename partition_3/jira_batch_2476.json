      "description": "I&#x27;m liking the new team/project functionality, with one glaring exception: if one gets a link, or finds one&#x27;s way, to a project (e.g., [this|https://bitbucket.org/account/user/epa_n2o_project_team/projects/EPAN2o]) one sees an almost-naked list of repositories. That&#x27;s all a project landing page currently is: a repository list! (Am I missing something?) This is _much_ less information-rich than a repo landing page. So I&#x27;d like to enquire about, and advocate for, something to serve a project in the same way that the current overview/README content on a landing page serves a repo. Some options that come to mind, in order (roughly) of increasing preference by me:\n\n# most minimally: display the project description on the project landing page. It might still be editable only via the project>Settings.\n# \"rich-up\" the project description (in addition to showing it on the project landing page). E.g., allow composing/editing it with the same sort of Markdown support as you use for these Issues.\n# an all-the-way project README, supporting the same range of markup as a repo README. (Definitely reST :-) Might be difficult, depending on how you&#x27;ve implemented projects.\n# a project-designatable \"master repo.\" I suspect this is a strategy OP have adopted, and I certainly have, esp \"back in the day\" before Bitbucket got Projects: one had a single master repo which pointed to and explained the others. (I&#x27;m currently extending this to a Project by having the [Project>Settings|https://bitbucket.org/account/user/epa_n2o_project_team/projects/EPAN2o/settings]>Description point to the landing page for my old master repo ... but until project descriptions are better surfaced, that&#x27;s kinda pointless.) The ease-of-implementation (for youse guys) advantage I can see (ICBW) for this option is that you could just\n\n* leverage (unchanged) the existing UI to set a repo&#x27;s landing page (in its Settings).\n* add UI to allow the user to designate a master repo (e.g., in the Project>Settings).\n* surface the content from the master repo&#x27;s landing-page on the project&#x27;s landing page. Perhaps without Edit decorations--user could still be required to do that via the master repo&#x27;s landing page.\n* make the project repo list a separate page accessible from the project landing page (as, e.g., Source, Issues, etc are for a repo&#x27;s landing page).\n\nApologies if this is a FAQ, but I saw no good match when searching Bitbucket issues, support, or documentation (or when I did a more general websearch).",

Clicking the edit link under an issue comment causes absolutely nothing to happen, i.e. nothing on the page reacts to the click.  Clicking the Merged or Declined links at the top of the PR page reloads the page, but it only ever shows the open PRs.  I can work around this by adding \"merged/\" to the end of the URL.\n\nI updated Safari from 7.1 to 9.0.3 to try and resolve these issues which started happening out of the blue this week (week of 2/26/2016). I cleared website data, reset Safari, installed the latest system update (10.9.5), restarted the computer, trashed the Safari prefs file... My colleague running the same version of Safari on Mac OS 10.11 doesn&#x27;t have this issue.  Everything works in Firefox...  I get this javascript error:\n\n{code}\n#!javascript\nTypeError: undefined is not an object (evaluating &#x27;i.timing&#x27;)\n(anonymous function)director.js:117\n(anonymous function)director.js:146\n(anonymous function)director.js:458\n(anonymous function)director.js:459\ntbootstrap 06f2b74b62d9549d8b4c:50\n(anonymous function)repositories-view.js:117\ntbootstrap 06f2b74b62d9549d8b4c:50\n(anonymous function)repositories-view.js:59\ntbootstrap 06f2b74b62d9549d8b4c:50\n(anonymous function)app.js:23\ntbootstrap 06f2b74b62d9549d8b4c:50\nwebpackJsonpbootstrap 06f2b74b62d9549d8b4c:21\n(anonymous function)app.js:1\n{code}\n\nHere&#x27;s a screen recording showing the PR behavior I&#x27;m seeing:\n\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/87939936/BUGS/mergedPRlinknotworking.mov\n\nHere&#x27;s a screen-cap of what I see at the bottom of open issues:\n\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/87939936/BUGS/nocommentfield.png\n\nHere&#x27;s what I expect to see (using Firefox):\n\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/87939936/BUGS/commentfieldinfirefox.png",

Conversely, a project may span across teams and repos. This is includes repos under individual accounts. Why do you force us to have a project for team accounts but not allow for projects under individual accounts?\n\nTherefore, the projects feature is otherwise redundant and should be optional for those wishing to use it, especially you don&#x27;t have it for individual accounts -- it means it must be possible for team accounts to disable it as well.

When I navigate to it via the menus, it uses the following URL:\n\n{code}\nhttps://bitbucket.org/account/user/team/projects/foo\n{code}\n\nNotice that it changed my project key to lowercase for the slug. Fine. I think it&#x27;s silly that the keys are forced to uppercase in the first place (as with Confluence).\n\nBut then I created another project named \"Foo Bar\" with a key {{FOO_BAR}}. When I navigate to it via the menus, it uses the following URL:\n\n{code}\nhttps://bitbucket.org/account/user/team/projects/FOO_BAR\n{code}\n\nWhat?? Why is Bitbucket seemingly using arbitrary case?\n\n(And why won&#x27;t it let me use a hyphen? But that&#x27;s another issue.)\n\nCan you please stick with either uppercase or lowercase for the project slug and be consistent across all projects?\n\n*Update:* This gets even crazier. I created a project named \"Examples\" and Bitbucket suggested a key of {{EXAM}}. So I added the letters {{PLES}} to the end, that is, to create the key {{EXAMPLES}}. Guess what URL I get?\n\n{code}\nhttps://bitbucket.org/account/user/team/projects/EXAMples\n{code}\n\nYes!! Now Bitbucket is mixing case, even when the key was entered (apparently) in all uppercase.\n\n*Update:* I went back and edited the key, both for {{FOO_BAR}} and {{EXAMPLES}}. I made sure I typed all the characters in _lowercase_ even though they appeared in the key field as _uppercase_. After saving the new settings, all the URLs were consistent with lowercase slugs:\n\n{code}\nhttps://bitbucket.org/account/user/team/projects/foo\nhttps://bitbucket.org/account/user/team/projects/boo_bar\nhttps://bitbucket.org/account/user/team/projects/examples\n{code}\n\nThe only explanation I can come up with is that on entry of the key when defining the project, Bitbucket must remember whether you typed the characters as uppercase or lowercase as saves the key as such, even though it _displays_ the project key invariables as uppercase in the project definition key field.\n\nAlthough I find this bug irritating, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if Atlassian discovers that it causes more serious bugs internally.",

I am able to find other posts about this same issue here, but it always results in someone at bitbucket fixing the problem on their end so I&#x27;m not really sure how to fix it.\n\nWhen pushing my commits to my repo, I get an error. Here is the exact error: \"HTTP Error: 500 (Internal Server Error)\". I am using TortoiseHG.\n\nI am able to push to other repositories on bitbucket, so it can&#x27;t be that bitbucket is down. Most threads I can find about the problem just show someone from Bitbucket solving the problem on their end. Is there a way for me to solve the problem?\n\nMore background: this is a repository that I have been pushing to regularly for a bit now. Recently I installed HG-Git for a separate project. I attached the extension in TortoiseHG correctly, then decided to use SourceTree instead for that project. I came back to this project and HG-Git was causing problems. I turned off the HG-Git extension in TortoiseHG settings and uninstalled HG-Git. And now instead of HG-Git errors, it&#x27;s giving me the error written above. It seems unlikely that SourceTree has anything to do with the problem but HG-Git and SourceTree are the only things I can think of that are different since this started happening.\n\nI also updated to the latest version of TortoiseHG, but that didn&#x27;t help.",
