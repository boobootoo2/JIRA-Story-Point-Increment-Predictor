One team will have several projects in a row and we want to use one Team Calendar for the different projects of one team. Each project is planned before it is signed off and released to the whole development team. There should be an option that enables us to not spam the whole team with changes made in the planning phase. Restricting a calendar is the obvious solution, but it doesn't work as expected.\n\n*Steps to reproduce: *\n1. All team members are watching a team space. \n2. A Team Calendar is added to this space. Some team members might even start watching the calendar directly.\n3. Viewing and editing the calendar is restricted to only one team member. \n\n*Actual result:* Other team members are getting e-mail notifications about the changes made in the calendar even though they can't view it. \n\n*Expected result:* If viewing of a calendar is restricted, then the people not permitted to view the calendar should not get any e-mail notifications, even if they are watching the respective space/calendar.\n\nIt would be great, if this issue could be fixed - thank you :-)\n\nPS: Please add a \"Restrictions\" component to the TEAMCAL project :-)",

Problem summary\nThere is a conflict in jquery.ui.datepicker.js: one date picker is from AUI and the other from Team Calendars. This can cause problems in date picker pop-ups for third-party plugin functionality, such as editing page contents with the Scaffolding Plugin from ServiceRocket.\n\nh2. Steps to reproduce\n# Install Confluence 5.8.18, Team Calendars 5.3.11, Scaffolding Plugin 8.4.1\n# Install the above Confluence and plugins (trial licenses are fine)\n# Create a Confluence space and test page\n# Add a \"Date Data\" macro. Give it any name, and set the date format to \"MM-dd-yyyy\"\n# Save the page\n# The page should now have an \"Edit Contents\" option. Click this to go into the Scaffolding Editor\n# Click the calendar icon into the field\n\nh2. Expected Behavior\nDate picker should pop up, allowing users to configure both date and time\n\nh2. Actual behavior\nDate picker does not pop up, or a version of the date-only picker pops up without ability to set time. Using browser's developer console, the following error can be observed:\n\n!console.png|thumbnail! ",

[See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-48890].\n  {panel}\n\nSome users from one of our customers have trouble to change the color of their team calendars.\n\nAfter some analysis I discovered, that the REST endpoint color.json returns the following JSON:\n\n{code}\n{\"success\":false,\"fieldErrors\":[{\"field\":\"spaceKeyAutocomplete\",\"errorMessages\":[\"Ung\u00fcltiges Leerzeichen\"]}]}\n{code}\n\nThe users had no space configured. After I added a space to their calendars I could change to color.\n\nI'm not sure why they had no color. I can imagine two possible scenarios.\n\n1. the space was no required field in an older version of team calendars!?!\n2. the space the users configured for their calendar was renamed oder removed.\n\n*The major problem is that to user gets no information, why his attempts to change to color fail.*",

Summary\nTeam Calendars only imports .ics files that respects the [RFC-2445|https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2445.txt]. However, the Team Calendars plugin expects that the *end date* exists for every event, which is not actually mandatory according to the mentioned RFC:\n{quote}\n   2.  A calendar entry with a \"DTSTART\" property but no \"DTEND\"\n       property does not take up any time. It is intended to represent\n       an event that is associated with a given calendar date and time\n       of day, such as an anniversary. Since the event does not take up\n       any time, it MUST NOT be used to record busy time no matter what\n       the value for the \"TRANSP\" property.\n{quote}\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n# Install a Team Calendars in your Confluence\n# Import a Calendar using the *ConfluenceTeamCalendars_webcal.ics* file attached to this report.\n\nh3.

Summary\nSimilar to https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/TEAMCAL-3712\n\nEven when the time zone is properly configured to that of the user's, the event in the series of events can't be deleted. This applies across all calendars in our instance. They appear to delete at the time of the action, but refreshing the page shows that the events is still there. There are no errors in the front or the back end, even with DEBUG logging for Team Calendars.\n \n\nh3.Workaround To Temporarily Correct Issue*\n# Log in Confluence\n# Go to Team Calendars\n# Select \"Week\" from the tabs to make the events easier to read\n# Click on the event you are trying to delete and drag the event to an earlier time (e.g 30 minutes before)\n# Try to delete the event we just moved\n# You will likely get an error. You can ignore this error for now. \n# Refresh the page and the event will be automatically moved back to it's original spot\n# You should now be able to delete any of your calendars and events.\n\nNote: This is not a permanent workaround and the issue has been seen to re-surface after a few days. We recommend to upgrade Team Calendars to 5.3.11 for a permanent fix.",

Summary\n\nConfluence disabled users that subscribed to a calendar still receive notifications when calendar have new events added or when events in the subscribed calendar are modified. \n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n# Create a new user in Confluence\n# Make the new user watch a calendar in Team Calendar \n# Disabled the newly created user\n# Modified or add a new event into the watched calendar \n\nh3. Expected Results\n\nConfluence should acknowledge that a disabled users watched a calendar but won't process the notification as the users are disabled and therefore should not receive any updates/notification from Confluence as well as Team Calendar.\n\nh3. Actual Results\n\nConfluence process the notification and publish notification to disabled users.\n\nh3. Workaround\n\nAdministrator could try to update all disabled users e-mail address to another e-mail address. This way, disabled users won't receive the notification from Team Calendar in their e-mail address. Please execute this SQL query:\n\n{code:SQL}\nUPDATE cwd_user SET email_address = '<enter email address>' WHERE active = 'F';\nUPDATE cwd_user SET lower_email_address = '<enter email address all in lower case>' WHERE active = 'F';{code}\n",

No indication as to why workbox was suddenly disabled)\n# Install the Team Calendars add-on\n# Disable Team Calendars add-on\n# Disable workbox add-on. \n# Enable Team calendars. \n\nh3. Expected Results\nTeam Calendars would not silently fail with a vague log error that indicates a time out in the UI. \n\nh3. Actual Results\nThe below exception is thrown in the xxxxxxx.log file:\n{noformat}\n@40000000575667192d7e2034 2016-06-07 01:17:51,762 INFO [LandlordServiceAcceptTenantThread] [atlassian.plugin.manager.DefaultPluginManager] broadcastPluginDisabling Disabling com.atlassian.confluence.extra.team-calendars\n@400000005756683500f8505c 2016-06-07 01:22:35,016 http-nio-127.127.127.127-12998-exec-2 WARN anonymous 82x21x1 - 127.127.127.127 /instantupgrade [c.a.upm.mac.HostLicenseUpdatedHandlerImpl] UPM-5043 Detected a plugin which is licensed but not installed: com.atlassian.confluence.extra.team-calendar\n{noformat}\n \nh3.

Thank you for inplementing a long-awaited custom event types feature.\n\nNow while one could easely use russian characters in event description, and have it correctly display in the callendar, when you create an even type, and name it in russian (or any other cyrillic), you get ???????????? instead of a name when submitting new event type.\n\nPlease assist on how to be able to create event types in other languages.

However, the error message is set to show if there are more than 200 total events in the current view, the view before, and the view after, combined. For example, if you have the month of November pulled up with less than 200 events, but all events in October, November, and December equal more than 200, the error will display.\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n# Add less than 200 events for a month, but make sure to add enough events for the month before and the month after to go over the 200 limit when combined.\n\nh3.

Whenever it's using JIRA's filters or JQL it's OK (for JIRA issue date it's working using Filters or JQL).\nMy problem is, whenever it has to fetch a project list, it appears to be empty! JIRA Issue dates from project is answering \"No project found\", using JIRA Agile sprint dates and project versions are not working as well since the project dropdown is empty!\nWhen using JQL, I can use the autocompletion on \"project\" keyword...\nAlso, I configured the application link according to Atlassian documentation (especially about the URL Patterns).\n\nAny clues on why it's failing?\nThanks team!\n\nCheers,\nMicky",
