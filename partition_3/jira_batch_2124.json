Summary\r\n\r\nMultibyte characters (like Japanese or Chinese) get garbled in preview while they are [Supported languages|https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/languages-744721667.html].\r\nh4. Steps to reproduce\r\n # Upload text file [^memo.txt] which contains Japanese characters to a page in Confluence.\r\n # Click the document\r\n\r\n!Screenshot 2017-06-15 10.14.17.png|thumbnail!\r\nh4. Expected Results\r\n\r\nPreview correctly renders Japanese text _\"\u3042\u3044\u3046\u3048\u304a\"_.\r\nh4. Actual results\r\n\r\nJapanese characters get garbled.\r\nh4. Findings\r\n\r\nThe problem could be solved by the following knowledge base for Confluence Server (but not applicable to Confluence Cloud).\r\n - [Non-ASCII Characters display as Square Characters in Confluence|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CONFKB/Non-ASCII+Characters+display+as+Square+Characters+in+Confluence]\r\n\r\nThe knowledge base article tells the problem could be solved by installing proper font files to both OS and JVM. It seems the OS of Confluence Cloud already has proper font files, however, JVM is not. Users cannot install font files to JVM because the instance is Confluence Cloud.\r\nh4. Workaround\r\n - Download the file and read it on your local machine\r\n\r\nh4. Notes\r\n\r\nThis issue was originally raised for office macros and rewritten for preview. Office macros are no longer supported as described at [Deprecated macros for Confluence|https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/blog/2015/11/deprecated-macros-for-confluence], however the same unavailablilty persists at preview as well.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n!confluence-tofus.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

Can you at least indicate that this page has child pages that are being hidden? As an OnDemand (and therefore not a true) administrator, it's quite confusing to find that there's a page you can't see or find in any way.\n\nMy Use Case:\nI was trying to copy a page into a space, but the first attempt appeared to time out. After copying, I got an error message saying that there was already a page with that name in the space, but direct browsing, searching, and looking in 'Restricted Pages' resulted in nothing. I ended up needing to enter a support request as I thought the timed out copy attempt had created a ghost page I couldn't access. In the end, it turned out that another manager had created a page with the name I was trying to use, however as it was a child page I had no way of knowing where this page was or even that it was an actual page.",

We had a similar issue with the new inline comment functionality: https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-35750\n\nThey changed it to use  $('#content .wiki-content').first() instead. Which is working for us. They also mentioned that they would talk to the core team about adding IDs to the main wiki-content area so every one can select on ids instead.\n\nTo make our theme(RefinedWiki) compatible with the highlight function we've added the following code:\n{code}\n// FIX: .wiki-content:first is hardcoded in the confluence-highlight-actions projects\n// We need to change $root to the correct wiki-content area.\nvar originalComputeSearchTextObject = Confluence.HighlightAction.RangeHelper.computeSearchTextObject;\n\t\t\nConfluence.HighlightAction.RangeHelper.computeSearchTextObject = function ($root, selected)\n            {\n\t\t        // Check if the $root container is one of out custom sections\n\t\t        // If yes, get the correct $mainContent object\n\t\t        if ($root.hasClass('rw_custom_section') || $root.parent().hasClass('rw_custom_section'))\n\t\t            return originalComputeSearchTextObject($mainContent, selected);\n\t\t        else \n\t\t            return originalComputeSearchTextObject($root, selected);\n            }\n{code}\n\nCheers,\nEmil",
