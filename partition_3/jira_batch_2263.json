      "description": "Provide the ability to import sources on a per-project basis.\n\nI see at least 4 major advantages to supporting this:\n\n1. This would likely avoid the need for many people to do any sort of structural alterations to their repositories as described in your documentation.\n\n2. This would allow users to perform multiple imports without replacing the entire repository contents. Currently, each import after the first wipes out the existing repository contents. \n\n3. This might reduce the number of support requests for help with importing sources. (I don't know how many such requests you get, but I have made several requests myself that could have been eliminated completely by providing the functionality I propose here.)\n\n4. Migration efforts can be planned much more easily since it would allow planning the migration of one project at a time.\n\nOverall, this should save a great deal of time and frustration, for users as well as support staff.\n\nFor example, if I were to provide a dump file of the sources for a project with project key MYPROJ, and the dump file contained top level folders named branches, tags, and trunk, then the following command would import the dump file directly under the MYPROJ project folder, and I would have no need to alter the dump file:\n\n    svnadmin load REPOS_PATH --parent-dir MYPROJ < MYPROJ.dump\n\nI suggest you support this as the standard import functionality (or at least provide it as an option). The only additional step for a user that is starting an import of a particular dump file would be to specify which project to import the sources for. By doing this, you would know exactly what value to use for the --parent-dir option in the command above, which would obviously be the project key, since that is the value used for the top level folder for the project.\n\nThis would easily allow users to import code for each project at different times. Scheduling migration of every project for an organization from existing repositories to JIRA Studio is not something easy to manage. By allowing import of sources for individual projects, an organization can better manage and plan migration on a project-by-project basis. Migrating them all at once is not a reasonable expectation.\n\nThis also better supports existing external repositories commonly structured in any of the following ways:\n\n1. Single project per repository, where branches, tags, and trunk are the top level folders of the repository. What I propose here directly supports this approach because all that is required is a basic dump of the repository -- no changes required. This is fairly common, especially where organization have only one project.\n\n2. Multiple projects per repository, where each project is represented by a top level folder, with branches, tags, and trunk as child folders of each project folder. This would require a bit more effort, but would still be fairly straightforward. The top level project folder could be renamed (by various means) to match the JIRA Studio project key, then could be dumped (to include only everything under the project folder, not the whole repository).\n\n3. Single or multiple projects across multiple repositories. Same approach at above.\n\nThe current constraint where ALL project folders must be included in the dump file is far too restrictive and problematic. Allowing importing to a specific project should greatly simply efforts and reduce time spent, both for users and support staff.",

Atlassian Connect 1.0 [was released in March 2014|http://blogs.atlassian.com/2014/03/introducing-atlassian-connect-1-0/], and you can already get access to [more than 50 public add-ons today built using the platform|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/search?application=&category=&cost=&hosting=cloud&marketingLabel=].\r\n \r\nDue to stability and scalability reasons, we will not bundle additional third party add-ons with our Cloud offerings. But you should feel free to contact the vendors of your favourite add-ons to let them know that you would like them to create a Cloud version of the add-on! We will do our best to work together with the vendor to satisfy this request.\r\n \r\nSince we have no plans to bundle additional add-ons in Cloud, we are closing this issue.\r\n \r\nCheers,\r\nBartek\r\nJIRA Product Management\r\nbartek (at) atlassian (dot) com\r\n{panel}\r\n \r\n \r\n*Original request description:*\r\nhttps://plugins.atlassian.com/plugin/details/8129",

Atlassian Connect 1.0 [was released in March 2014|http://blogs.atlassian.com/2014/03/introducing-atlassian-connect-1-0/], and you can already get access to [more than 50 public add-ons today built using the platform|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/search?application=&category=&cost=&hosting=cloud&marketingLabel=].\r\n \r\nDue to stability and scalability reasons, we will not bundle additional third party add-ons with our Cloud offerings. But you should feel free to contact the vendors of your favourite add-ons to let them know that you would like them to create a Cloud version of the add-on! We will do our best to work together with the vendor to satisfy this request.\r\n \r\nSince we have no plans to bundle additional add-ons in Cloud, we are closing this issue.\r\n \r\nCheers,\r\nBartek\r\nJIRA Product Management\r\nbartek (at) atlassian (dot) com\r\n{panel}\r\n \r\n \r\n*Original request description:*\r\nCan we please have this plugin installed into Dev Studio instance.  We wpuld like to be able to link our Decv Studio instance with Onepoint Project Management.\r\n\r\nSee http://www.onepoint-project.com/products/options#\r\n",
