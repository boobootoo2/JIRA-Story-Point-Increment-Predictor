All I can do is show hide left and right sidebar.\u00a0\r\nThis appear at the end of the first file : \r\nTo view another file, use the file tree in the right sidebar or navigation buttons in the header.\r\n\r\nOk but can I use the navigation without a mouse ? What is annoying in this context is that there isn't a file view... So you must navigate from previous/next file until you get the right file. With 131 files changed, it's inefficient navigating in all those files... I can't imagine what reviewing a PR double that size could be...\u00a0\r\n\r\nAnyway, to summaries in bullet point :\r\n * Navigating through keyboard in Pull Request would help a lot.\r\n ** Next/Previous file.\r\n ** Next/Previous hunk.\r\n ** Collapse/Display current hunk.\r\n ** Navigate lines.\r\n ** Add comment for the line/files.\r\n * Having a file explorer as sidebar would help review/navigate to a specific file when needed.\r\n\r\nI have use Azure DevOps for the past 3 years. I can said that navigating in Bitbucket is not as easy nor intuitive. Maybe I'm not used to the workflow, but I definitely think those 2 bullets points are a must have that is missing.",

Issue Summary\r\nWhen you perform a pull request on a repository, you will receive an e-mail even if you aren't watching the repository in *Personal Settings > Notification Settings*\r\nI have had a customer comment that this is bordering on spam, he needs to un-watch the pull request to stop receiving notification emails on it despite being unsubscribed from all objects in his repository. As soon as he performs another pull request, he is again notified in his inbox and must un-watch that pull request. He is the only person in his workspace, therefore he doesn't need these emails to be sent when he is the one performing all the pull requests.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Un-watch the repository you are creating a pull request for in *Personal Settings > Notification Settings*\r\n # Perform a pull request on that repository and merge, notification email is still received\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nRepository is unsubscribed, therefore no email notification is sent\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nRepository is unsubscribed, email notification is still sent\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nCurrently there is no known workaround for this behavior. A workaround will be added here when available",

      "description": "h3. Update: This issue is fixed\r\n\r\nBitbucket Cloud now supports\u00a0{{rsa-sha2-256}}\u00a0and\u00a0{{rsa-sha2-512}}\u00a0algorithms. The OpenSSH 8.8 client will function without the need for a workaround.\r\n\r\nThe team deployed a fix on Tuesday, Oct 19. After monitoring for two days, this ticket was closed because we are confident that the OpenSSH 8.8 incompatibility has been resolved.\r\n----\r\nh3. Issue Summary\r\n\r\nThe latest release of OpenSSH \u2014 version 8.8, released on September 26th \u2014 introduced a configuration change that prevents that client from connecting to Bitbucket Cloud over SSH. Bitbucket engineers are actively addressing this, and there are workarounds available in the meantime.\r\n\r\nSee the [Community post|https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Bitbucket-articles/OpenSSH-8-8-client-incompatibility-and-workaround/ba-p/1826047] for more details.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nConnect to bitbucket.org using OpenSSH >= 8.8.\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nSSH client connects to Bitbucket.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nSSH connection fails with the following error message:\r\n\r\n{{Unable to negotiate with <ip address> port 22: no matching host key type found. Their offer: ssh-rsa,ssh-dss}}\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nIf you are receiving the warning above, there are two options: updating your SSH config locally, or switching from SSH to HTTPS.\r\nh4. Update local SSH configuration\r\n\r\nYou can continue to use SSH by adding the lines below into the {{Host bitbucket.org}} section of your SSH configuration:\r\n\r\n{{Host bitbucket.org}}\r\n {{\u00a0 \u00a0HostkeyAlgorithms +ssh-rsa}}\r\n {{\u00a0 \u00a0PubkeyAcceptedAlgorithms +ssh-rsa}}\u00a0\r\n\r\nOn Unix-like systems, this configuration is located at {{$HOME/.ssh/config}} or {{/etc/ssh/ssh_config}}.\r\n\r\nOn Windows systems, this configuration is located at {{%USERPROFILE%\\.ssh\\config}} or {{%PROGRAMFILES%\\Git\\etc\\ssh\\ssh_config}}.\r\nh4. Use HTTPS instead of SSH\r\n\r\nHTTPS connections to Bitbucket Cloud are unaffected by changes to the OpenSSH client. Therefore, you can avoid this issue by updating your git client to use HTTPS instead of SSH to talk to Bitbucket Cloud by following the instructions on [this page|https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/change-the-remote-url-to-your-repository/]. Switching to HTTPS will require using a different authentication mechanism. We recommend using an [app password|https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/app-passwords/] for automated git clients such as build machines or if you have two-factor authentication enabled.\r\n\r\nTo remove this workaround in the future, follow [the same instructions|https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/change-the-remote-url-to-your-repository/] to change your remote URL back to the SSH URL.",
