It would be useful if clicking on any step in the process diagram led you to the corresponding page.\n\nThe current solution we are using is to create image maps in Visio, exporting to HTML, using a perl script we have written to convert the imagemap to the format supported by the image map plugin (http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CONFEXT/ImageMap+Plugin), and pasting that into confluence.\n\nObviously this process could be much more streamlined, and would probably useful to many other users of the product if it was nice and easy to use.",

However, this styling is not picked up by the Export to PDF/Word feature of Confluence, with the result that all such output is unusable (because the navbar takes up half the width of the page).\n\nAs an aside, I used to use the {hide-if:display=printable} macro to disable the navbar when clicking on the Print link in Confluence.  However, the print link seems to have disappeared after our Confluence instance was upgraded to 2.8.1 and the {hide-if:display=printable} macro no longer appears to have an effect.\n\nRegards\nKevin",

If the system clock jumps backwards, then any tasks that were scheduled before the backward jump will not occur until the clock catches up again.\n\nThis has happened at least once on a virtualised machine, and was somewhat difficult to track down.  It manifested most obviously as \"indexing stops working for a while, then resumes\"\n\nIdeally Confluence or Quartz would guard against weird time fluctuations in some way.\n\n(Note that I've put this in the Search/Indexing component because there's no \"scheduled jobs\" component)",

However, Confluence contains no check that the home directory it is running against has not been upgraded beyond the software.  This allows customers to \"downgrade\" to an older version and risk things going horribly wrong.  Usually this happens after a partially failed upgrade.  Most of the time an older version of Confluence will \"pretty much\" work against an upgraded instance, but there is no guarantee of that.  When things *do* go wrong, there's nothing logged to tell the customer or support staff to tell them about the mismatched home and software versions which unnecessarily complicates matters.\n\nIdeally Confluence would refuse to start up if the build number in the home directory is higher than the software's build number.  This will infuriate customers who've upgraded unsuccessfully, but at least they will be correctly forced to revert to a backup, rather than risking unknown corruption of data. ",

We already provide two different colors for our comments, so a highlight color that grabs your attention needs to really be ridiculously eye-catching.\n\nAnd, this is still not an ideal solution. For instance, I open a lot of new tabs through links - hopefully the fade effect would not kick in until I actually looked at that tab for the first time - often, I open the tab 'in the background' without immediately switch over to view it.\n\nBasically, I thought comment permalinks were broken - I thought we needed to provide a lot of whitespace at the bottom of each page, but I guess this is the new way to do it. I probably would not have been as confused if we really highlighted the comment I was heading to.\n\nUse Javascript to highlight selected comment on permalinks\nhttp://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-11903\n\nExample link:\nhttp://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Known+Issues+for+Resin+3.x?focusedCommentId=147187#comment-147187\n",

This feature is currently present in Mediawiki where you can create a Category and sub-categories. An example of this may be that we would like to label pages with CRM that have to do with CRM and when clicking this label see Microsoft Dynamics, Salesforce.com etc as sub-labels to this label. Vice Versa if you click on a MS Dynamics label you would want to see that it is a sub-label of CRM (and maybe also of Microsoft)\n\nThe user benefit lies in the fact that it allows to group labels into subsections.\n\nIt would also be nice if the output could be such that like in the Wikipedia it gets ordered alphabetically and shows all the subpages etc http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Cartilaginous_fishes",

Otherwise unsupported - and probably unnoticed and unwanted - legacy plugins *persisted in the external database* will prevent would-be migrators from even reaching first screen in confluence - unless outdated plugins have been fully purged. The new 2.9 release of Confluence will not even start.\n\nThis is not documented clearly in [our upgrade docs | http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Upgrading+Confluence+Standalone+Edition#UpgradingConfluenceStandaloneEdition-ReapplyingCustomisationstoyourNewConfluence]\n{quote}If you were previously using any plugins, install the latest compatible version and disable any plugins that are incompatible with your new version of Confluence.

The problem we face is that all of this goes to waste when we need to upgrade the application, because in order to do that we need to shut down the entire cluster.\n\nThis is becoming more and more unacceptable as our user base grows because a 5-10min outage often translates to thousands of missed page views.\n\nI understand that sometimes it is not (easily) possible to deliver this feature - mainly in cases when the new version of the application depends on a database schema, which is incompatible with the previous version.\n\nOn the other hand, changes like this don't happen very often and in many cases database schema changes often don't break the previous application (the old application just can't take advantage of the new schema features because it is not aware of them).\n\nWhat I suggest is to allow cluster upgrades without the requirement to shut down the cluster whenever possible. IMO this means most of the time if the version of the application used in the cluster is not very outdated.\n\nI realize that this will most likely require someone to watch schema changes or other changes that would make \"hot\" cluster upgrade impossible (incompatibilities in the serialized objects, coherence upgrades, etc), but it shouldn't be too difficult for anyone who is heavily involved in the Confluence development.\n\nHigh availability is not an optional feature for Enterprise applications, so please consider this request and make necessary changes to the application as well as to the development/release processes to make Confluence more Enterprise friendly.",

The above action just displays the web page.)\n\nSometimes either Confluence is down completely or is just malfunctioning for any number of reasons (corrupt db) - it would be nice if i could tell a customer to just go into their 'bin' directory and run the 'raisesupportrequest.sh' script. The script might ask a quick question or two and then ask for confirmation that they wanted to submit a support request before actually sending the request. We might ask whether they want to use a configured mail server or the local mail user agent/mta (e.g. /usr/bin/mail), or even if they want us to zip the info packet into a zip on the filesystem that they could then get to us however they wanted.\n\nMaybe it's possible to try and re-use the RaiseSupportRequestAction.java class. Things we might have to do:\n1) Get path to java (using $JAVA_HOME, etc.)\n2) Set up classpath\n3) set up shell-script wrapper to ask at least one question ('Are you sure you want to submit a support request?').\n4) Possibly do the add-on question for asking about which mail client/server to use.\n\nThis makes support easier on the end user, makes the Support Department more efficient (b/c we get the info we need, and we get it quickly, without spending time on the phone), and should ultimately make us more effective.\n\nIn theory, this could be relatively easy to accomplish.",

Again, any change you make would be persistent, by default, so using the 'Add Entry' button, for instance, would create/update a logging level that is changed immediately for runtime, but also changed permanently.\n\nAnd this 'changes are persisted by default' philosophy would hold for the whole page - profiling, logging, etc.\n",

This impairs the users trust of the filter. Perhaps it would be good to show a field along the lines of 'created by' or 'modified by' beside each match.\n\nTo go a step further, author filtering will match a document if the author entered made any change to any version. e.g. cmonger changed version 3 only of a document that is now at version 25. Even when clicking on the hit it may not be obvious why this document has matched. Could we extend the display on the hit list with something like 'version 3 edited by cmonger'? At present this would mean a version look up in the DB which we may want to avoid.\n\nAlternative thinking could be to only record a particular editor as a contributor if they changed more than x% of the document etc.",

This same approach is used for the notes at the top of many pages about how the page should be improved. (See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:A_quick_guide_to_templates for the details.)\n\nIs there any way to achieve the same thing in Confluence? The \"Include Page\" macro does let me include one wiki page inside another, but it apparently doesn't have any ability to substitute values into the rendered page. And Confluence's built-in template support is not useful here, because the template is not referenced again after initial page creation.\n{quote}",

So a lot of macros implement some kind of macroId variable that's substituted into the HTML/JavaScript it outputs.\n\nThis is easy enough to implement, but it is duplicated across several plugins, with a variety of different implementations, and you'd be surprised how often people have trouble with it or just get it wrong (e.g., see CONF-12125, which is caused by a user macro that tries to use a random number as the macro id!)\n\nIf the framework passed a macroId to each macro and user macro, it would be a small but useful improvement to the plugin development experience.",
