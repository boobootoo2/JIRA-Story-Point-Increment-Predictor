We have on the roadmap adding a 'Project Summary' tab to the JIRA project dashboard. This tab would contain wiki content, as well as configurable links for downloads, etc. Additionally, we've got planned to add a 'Team' tab which contains a listing of team members w/ picture & contact info. Sounds kind of like what you have in mind here. If you have a few minutes, would you mind expanding on your ideas? I'd like to get a better understanding of what you're hoping to see, and we can take these into account as we develop the specs.\n\nMichael ",

Kevin Pierce (kpierce@vendasta.com) says:\n\n> The only tool we forsee truely needing to handled ourselves inhouse is\n> svn, since we use this heavily for all types of activity and require\n> real network connectivity.\n\nJust for your consideration.\n\nCustomer comment:\n\nGus Heck - 18/Mar/08 05:48 PM\nNot having admin access to one's repository gives me the willies. If anything gets messed up (such as accidental check in of sensitive information that must be removed) the inability to shut down access, dump/filter/etc is a serious problem (and yes I've had to do that :-( ). However, if one could connect your services with a repository that I can manage freely. Also, having my code live elsewhere and only being able to get a backup via a service ticket is an issue. Are you prepared for users that file weekly tickets for backups? And the faq seems to indicate that none of the backups you do can be re-loaded, so if something goes wrong the only option is to quit using Jira studio to fix the problem? what is the use of a backup that can't be loaded?\n\nDon't get me wrong, I love the idea that I one could potentially get going on Jira/confluece/fisheye/crucible for only $50/month. That's an awesome concept, but having to put my subversion there is something I view as an additional cost. What would be a benefit would be a service to automatically replicate or back up my subversion repository. Perhaps you could have a mode where a regular polling for new versions on an external server is done and then when new versions are detected, a robot client updates to each version successively and checks in the changes to the repository at Atlassian one by one.\n\nIn pseudo code:\n\nwhile(accountIsPaidUp())\n  if(newVersionsFound())\n    foreach(getNewVersionList() as v )\n      updateCheckoutSpaceToVersion(v)\n      copyNonSubversionFilesToCheckinSpace()\n      Options opts = determineCheckInOptions() // this is possibly difficult :)\n      commitCheckinSpace(options)\n\nThat would allow you to have all the integration with your tools operating locally. There's probably a bit more with some of the other funky bits of subversion like locks, but I'll leave that as an exercise for the folks who're getting paid for this :) Anyway, just a thought for you because I definately like where you are going, but I'm not sure I could follow yet.\n\nI would expect that an account set up to use external repositories would NOT be allowed to make any changes to the atlassian copy of the repository directly (only via the mirroring process).\n",

Pull in the Crowd guys on this, as I'm certain its a Crowd caching issue.\n\n*From the ticket:*\nWe are paying for a 5 user license for Jira Studio. I've created 2 users, both of whom will have admin rights. But the Studio Administration page says that we only have two more users left to assign, and offers to upgrade.\n\nWe do not need a user called \"admin\" and have exactly 5 users whom we need to assign access to Jira Studio. When I try to delete this generic admin user (from my username of stu, which has administration rights) I get the following message:\n\n\"Exception trying to remove user: com.opensymphony.user.ImmutableException: Credentials provider failed to remove user\"\n\nIt's fine if atlassian would like this user to be there for their purposes, but not if it counts against the user quota we're paying for. If we're paying per user, and have 5 users to assign, it is not acceptable that in reality we have only 4. This will be a showstopper for us, so I look forward to your response.\n\n*Then:*\nArgh! Now the admin user is gone. It's what I wanted, but it's confusing to me why I got an error message saying the remove failed (which is why I submitted the ticket) and when I re-login it is gone. Np, I'm happy with the outcome. A bit odd though.\n\nExcited about exploring Jira Studio. We've been waiting for this to go live for a while, and it looks like a fantastic product.",

From that date, the documentation in that space will begin to reflect Confluence 2.8 rather than 2.7. But JIRA Studio uses version 2.7.\n\nIs it possible to implement a global redirect from anything beginning with \n{code}\nhttp://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC\n{code}\nto point to this instead:\n{code}\nhttp://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CONF27\n{code}\n\nThere are online help links in the Confluence application.
